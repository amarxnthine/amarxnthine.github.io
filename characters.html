<h2>Attributes:</h2>
<p>When creating a character, the player assigns a value to each of the six Primary Attributes, typically ranging from 1 to 5, with the human maximum being a 6. This is done, as stated before, by “buying” an Attribute value with the available character points. This value represents the limits of the character with that Attribute. The higher the Attribute value, the more accomplished the character is in that area. The following paragraphs express some guidelines for Attribute levels 1 to 5.<br><br>

Level 1: The character is below average in that Attribute. A Strength of 1 indicates a poor physique,either a petite or flabby, sedentary person. A Dexterity of 1 indicates clumsiness, a character who is likely to drop things, not to be trusted with delicate manual work unless the person has trained very hard to do so. An Intelligence of 1 is below average -- not mentally challenged, but certainly a bit slow on the uptake. A Perception of 1 is the trait of a character who is not very aware of his surroundings, and likely to miss what’s going on around him. Characters with a Constitution of 1 are delicate and often in poor health: they are the ones who get sick first, and their low physiques may be caused by abuse of drugs, tobacco or alcohol. A Willpower of 1 depicts a person who is easily influenced by others, a follower,and somebody who is likely to succumb to temptation.<br><br>

Level 2: This is the average for human beings. Most people in any given group have Attributes in this range, typically with one or two Attributes at levels 1 or 3.<br><br>

Level 3: This is above average but not extraordinary. A Strength and Constitution of 3 show some athletic aptitude, probably belonging to somebody who works out regularly and vigorously, or a natural athlete who has not taken time to develop his talent.Characters with a Dexterity of 3 are graceful individuals. Intelligence 3 indicates a bright person who can easily learn new skills, if he has the temperament to do so. With a Perception of 3, the character has good sens-es and intuition, and is not easily fooled or confused. A character with a Willpower of 3 is rarely convinced or bullied under normal circumstances.<br><br>

Level 4: An Attribute at level 4 is well above average. Very few people -- perhaps one out of every ten in a random group -- have an Attribute at this level. Strength and Constitution 4 can be found only in athletes,including the best football players in a large high school, or college campus, extensively trained Special Forces soldiers, and other people who spend a large amount of time and effort keeping in shape. A Dexterity of 4 would only be common among gymnasts, acrobats, dancers and other talented individuals. Mental Attributes at level 4 indicate near genius (Intelligence), very acute senses and intuition (Perception), or an“iron will” (Willpower).<br><br>

Level 5: This is the “practical” human limit. While people with Attributes at level 5 are not “record breakers,” they are among the best and the brightest representatives of humanity. In a small or medium-sized community, only a handful of people will have one or two Attributes at this level, and they are likely to be well-known for their strength, wisdom or toughness. Cities, large college campuses, and groupings of Survivors have more of these extraordinary individuals, but even there they will not be common.</p>

<h3>Primary Attributes</h3>
<p><b>Strength:</b> A measure of the physical power of the character, Strength determines how much damage the character inflicts with hand-to-hand weapons, how much weight he can carry, and how powerful he is. It also helps determine how much damage and exertion the character can withstand before collapsing. Strength is useful to people who do a lot of heavy lifting or anybody likely to enter close combat. Characters apt to have a high Strength include athletes, manual workers, and soldiers. A low Strength indicates either small size and body weight, or just a lack of exercise. A character may high jump (Strength x 10) inches (x 2.5 cm) and broad jump (Strength) yards (meters). Double these numbers with a good running start. This is the weight someone of that Strength can lift without much effort. Higher weights can be lifted with some effort (assume a maximum lifting weight -- for brief periods -- equal to double the Lifting Capacity). A character can “push the limits” and try to lift more by passing a Simple Strength Test. Every Success Level achieved allows the character to lift an additional 10% of his maximum lifting weight. This effort costs the character D4(2) points of Endurance for every Success Level in the Test. A failure on the Strength Test causes D4(2) Life Points of damage -- the character strained himself and tore something up...  <br><br>
1-5 50 lbs/25 kg x Strength (Strength 5: 250 lbs/125 kg)<br>
6-10 200 lbs/100 kg (Strength - 5) + 250 lbs/125 kg<br>
11-15 500 lbs/250 kg x (Strength - 10) + 1,250 lbs/625 kg<br>
16-20 1,000 lbs/500 kg x (Strength - 15) + 5,000 lbs/2,500 kg <br><br>

<b>Dexterity:</b> Dexterity is a measure of the character’s coordination, agility, and gracefulness. It is used to determine how proficient a character is with any Task that requires motor control and precision. This ranges from performing card tricks to picking pockets to punching somebody in the face (Dexterity helps the punch land; Strength determines how much the punch hurt the other guy). Any Task where the character’s speed and coordination matter is influenced by Dexterity. A high Dexterity is common among dancers, gymnasts, or pickpockets. People with low Dexterity are clumsy and ungraceful. <br><br>

<b>Constitution:</b>
This Attribute determines how physically hardy or healthy the character is. Constitution is important when it comes to resisting diseases, damage, and fatigue. This Attribute is used (along with Strength) to determine how much physical injury the character can survive and still remain functional. Constitution also comes into play with physical skills that involve endurance, like swimming, long-distance running and the like. <br><br>

<b>Intelligence:</b> 
This Attribute determines the character’s ability to learn, correlate and memorize information. The higher a character’s Intelligence, the easier it is to improve scholastic skills. Also, this Attribute is used to understand and interpret information. Note that Intelligence and education are two separate things. A person can be brilliant but illiterate. Education is covered in the Skills section, which determines what a character has learned in his life. <br><br>

<b>Perception:</b>
Perception governs the five senses of the character. It gives a general overview of the sharpness of the character’s ability to sense things. This Attribute is used to find clues, notice things, and avoid getting surprised. Also, Perception determines the character’s intuition and alertness. A character with a low Perception would be nearly oblivious to what is going on around him. <br><br>

<b>Willpower:</b>
This Attribute measures the mental strength and self-control of the character, and his ability to resist fear, intimidation, and temptation. Willpower is important for some of the Inspired’s Miracles. It is also important for Norms and Survivors, for it can be used to resist magical coercion, psychic mind control, and the influence of panic, among other things.</p>

<h3>Secondary Attributes</h3>
<p><b>Life Points:</b> This Attribute determines the physical health of the character. The Strength and Constitution of the character are the determining factors. A big, muscle-bound athlete can survive more punishment than a pencil-necked, cold-catching nerd. On the other hand, a bullet to the head or a solid whack with an ax will probably kill either character with the same ease. Life Points indicate the amount of physical damage the character can take before being unable to function. Other things that drain Life Points include disease, extreme fatigue, and some supernatural attacks. <br><br>

<b>Endurance Points:</b> Endurance Points measure the character’s ability to withstand fatigue and exertion before collapsing. Like Life Points, Endurance Points use Constitution and Strength, but they also use Willpower, taking into account that some people can push themselves past normal physical limits through the sheer force of will. The more Endurance Points a character has, the longer he can run,lift things, swim, etc. As the character exerts himself, he starts losing Endurance Points. When Endurance Pointsare reduced to 0, the character sooner or later passes out from exhaustion (see Endurance Point Loss, p. 114). Insome cases, light damage from non-lethal attacks is subtracted from Endurance Points instead of Life Points.Formula: Add Constitution, Strength and Willpower together, multiply by three, and add 5 to the result. The formula is best written as ((Constitution + Strength +Willpower) x 3) + 5. The human range is 14 to 59. <br><br>

<b>Speed:</b> This Attribute represents how fast a person can run at maximum speed. It only comes into play on the few occasions when running speed will be a consideration, such as when a character is chasing or being chased by somebody.Formula:(Constitution + Dexterity) x 2 is the speed in miles per hour (for kilometers per hour change the multiplier to 3). The human range is 4 to 24 mph (6 to 36 kph. Half that amount is the number of yards (meters) that the character runs in a second. <br><br>

<b>Essence Pools:</b> Essence is the amount of spiritual energy the character has within himself. It measures, basically, the strength of the character’s soul and life force. Essence is also the binding force of reality. This means that inside each human being are the building blocks of Creation. Inspired Miracles can channel Essence for a variety of powerful effects. Although Essence is used primarily in the performance of Miracles, it can also be temporarily drained by strong emotions (like fear and hatred), and by the attacks of some supernatural creatures. Totally draining a human being of Essence can lead to his death.<p>
