<div class="heading">About the Zombies</div>
<ul> 
	<li>Extreme flu mutation? Air + contact spread, “everyone is infected” kind of thing and then reanimates post-death Walking Dead style.</li>
	<li>A contact-only mutated virus of some kind. Anyone who has the virus enter the bloodstream (generally from a bite, but also potentially from infected matter coming in to contact with open wounds) reanimates after death. If you weren't bitten or scratched, you won't turn after death.</li>
	<li>Fairly quick incubation period from time of infection until time of death - between 2 and 24 hours depending on the person. Much, much quicker if mauled.</li>
	<li>Zombies will leave the brain in tact when consuming bodies, allowing for the newly-dead to reanimate.</li>
</ul></p>

<div class="header">Starting Point</div>
<p>Small town vs bigger city. Suburbs? Apartment building? Shopping mall? Something with run-of-the-mill people rather than hardened survivor types. <br><br>

Perhaps a military quarantine zone? Best suited to a military base, but could turn anything guardable in to one. Not sure if the characters should be part of it, but if so it allows for introduction of military members in to the cast. It would inevitably fall somehow. </p>

<div class="header">Moving Forward</div>
<p>I don't have anything for this part of the story just yet, but I do have generators for looting and coming up with people/zombie/location encounters and npc creation so that should help fill things in a little bit.</p>
