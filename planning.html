	<li>Pub/bar</li>
</ul></p>

<p><b>Situations:</b>
<ul>
	<li>A large but precariously balanced object balanced at the top of a parking garage ramp near a large group of zombies. Setting it rolling will kill a whole load of them at once. Practically it'll also make a lot of noise but damn it'll be satisfying.</li>
	<li>HSome badass who thought he was too cool for teamwork and went out loaded with guns. Ended up being too weighed down to run away and now he's a zombie. Still has his combat bandoleer full of the guns and ammo he fetishised during life though./li>
	<li>Drive through an underpass or tunnel only run right into 100's of zombies on the other side.</li>
	<li>Someone is trapping zombies in the area. He/she/they are luring mobs into sealed areas with loud music, played on portable stereos with remote controls. These zombies are locked in gymnasiums, natatoriums, and other buildings with large spaces but small exits, with the doors securely sealed and blocked off. The captors may have been considerate enough to put signs up, reading "DON'T OPEN. DEAD INSIDE.", but who's going to let that be. If they're still in the area, they're not going to be happy if you undo all their hard work.</li>

</ul></p>

<p><b>NPC/Group Encounters:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Living person disguised as a zombie. Could be trying to avoid their notice. Could be delusional.</li>
	<li>Another survivor group in the middle of looting a store. They're armed and unwilling to share, but your group is between them and an easy escape. Could become a horrible gunfight, could become a siege.</li>
	<li> A paranoid sniper in a clocktower above a barricaded store. He won't let you near "his" supplies--which he considers to be anything he can see through his scope. You can turn back or get shot, as far as he's concerned. But there's a big horde behind you, so if you go back, you're probably zombie chow.
</li>
	<li>A shopkeeper who doggedly keeps her convenience store open out of a sense of duty to her rapidly dwindling community. Buys and sells goods. </li>
	<li>Quarry/Mine</li>
	<li>Prison</li>
	<li>Military base </li>
	<li>Pub/bar</li>
</ul></p>

<p><b>Locations:</b>
<ul>
	<li>A plagueship. A vacation cruise ship that has been drifting, filled with zombies (and possibly a few survivors) and a lot of supplies. The ship is headed for shallow waters, and if it runs aground, a whole horde will end up shambling ashore. That being said, the supplies are drawing survivors like buzzards to roadkill, willing to risk the ship's residents to salvage food and supplies. Very few of them are willing to share, and it's only a matter of time before the ship runs aground and sinks, destroying the majority of what's aboard.</li>
