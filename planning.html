<div class="heading">About the Zombies</div>
<ul> 
	<li>Extreme flu mutation? Air + contact spread, “everyone is infected” kind of thing and then reanimates post-death Walking Dead style.</li>
	<li>A contact-only mutated virus of some kind. Anyone who has the virus enter the bloodstream (generally from a bite, but also potentially from infected matter coming in to contact with open wounds) reanimates after death. If you weren't bitten or scratched, you won't turn after death.</li>
	<li>Fairly quick incubation period from time of infection until time of death - between 2 and 24 hours depending on the person. Much, much quicker if mauled.</li>
	<li>Zombies will leave the brain in tact when consuming bodies, allowing for the newly-dead to reanimate.</li>
</ul></p>

<div class="heading">Starting Point</div>
<p>Small town vs bigger city. Suburbs? Apartment building? Shopping mall? Something with run-of-the-mill people rather than hardened survivor types. <br><br>

Perhaps a military quarantine zone? Best suited to a military base, but could turn anything guardable in to one. Not sure if the characters should be part of it, but if so it allows for introduction of military members in to the cast. It would inevitably fall somehow. </p>

<div class="heading">Post-Apocalyptic To-Do List</div>
<p><b>Machinery of Life:<b>
<ul>
	<li>Power - getting a generator and/or procuring fuel. Learn how to make power. <br>
	<ul>
	<li>Ethanol fuel - Mechanics/INT C to make fermentation vats, Mechanic/INT Difficult to make and maintain distillation stills. Modifying car engines to take ethanol is a Mechanic/INT Difficult challenge that makes them less efficient.</li>
	<li>	Mechanical - some horses walking in a circle could do it. Mechanics/INT Average but you would need deep cycle batteries/capacitors (Electronics/INT Difficult) or else the power goes out the moement they stop.</li>
	<li>	Coal/Wood - a steam boiler requires a heat source, ie a furnace, the steam boiler a (Mechanics/INT Challenging test to create) and a turbine or crankshaft arrangement to transfer power (a Mechanics/INT Difficult challenge to make).</li>
	<li>	Solar-powered electrical generators can be a good source of power, if you can find one or the materials needed to make them (Savenging/INT Heroic). Solar-powered water stills and heaters are relatively easy to make (Mechanics/INT Challenging) as long as you can find the polished metal and mirrors for it (Scavenging/INT Challenging)</li>
	<li>	Wind - A windmill can be made of an airplane propeller and a car's drive train can be hooked up to a low-yield generator (Mechanics/INT Difficult). A steady supply of wind is required, but it can be worth it.</li>
	<li>	Hydroelectric - a waterwheel with a magnet attached to it can generate power enough to run some lights or even a power tool or two - Mechanics/INT Challenging. A steady supply of water is required, but it can be worth it.</li>
</ul></li>
	<li>Find a water source & a way to maintain it. Iodine tables, hydrogen peroxide, chlorine to treat - make sure to boil untreated water. </li>
	<li>Find food - and then learn to harvest and store it yourself. Hydroponics gardens, grain silos, preserving fruits/vegetables.</li>
	<li>Communication - ideally a ham radio. Walkie talkies last as long as batteries do. </li>
	<li>Lighting - oil lamps, flashlights, candles. Light bulbs will require power. Wiring a power system with lights is relatively easy - Mechanics/DEX A.</li>
	<li>Transportation - finding and maintaining good vehicles can be a problem. Things fall apart and need repairing, gas becomes rarer. Potentially modifying cars - weapon mounts, armor plating? </li>
</ul>
