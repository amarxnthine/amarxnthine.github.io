<div class="heading">About the Zombies</div>
<ul> 
	<li>Extreme flu mutation? Air + contact spread, “everyone is infected” kind of thing and then reanimates post-death Walking Dead style.</li>
	<li>A contact-only mutated virus of some kind. Anyone who has the virus enter the bloodstream (generally from a bite, but also potentially from infected matter coming in to contact with open wounds) reanimates after death. If you weren't bitten or scratched, you won't turn after death.</li>
	<li>Fairly quick incubation period from time of infection until time of death - between 2 and 24 hours depending on the person. Much, much quicker if mauled.</li>
	<li>Zombies will leave the brain in tact when consuming bodies, allowing for the newly-dead to reanimate.</li>
</ul></p>

<div class="heading">Starting Point</div>
<p>Small town vs bigger city. Suburbs? Apartment building? Shopping mall? Something with run-of-the-mill people rather than hardened survivor types. <br><br>

Perhaps a military quarantine zone? Best suited to a military base, but could turn anything guardable in to one. Not sure if the characters should be part of it, but if so it allows for introduction of military members in to the cast. It would inevitably fall somehow. </p>

<div class="heading">Post-Apocalyptic To-Do List</div>
<p><b>Machinery of Life:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Power - getting a generator and/or procuring fuel. Learn how to make power. <br>
	<ul>
	<li>Ethanol fuel - Mechanics/INT C to make fermentation vats, Mechanic/INT Difficult to make and maintain distillation stills. Modifying car engines to take ethanol is a Mechanic/INT Difficult challenge that makes them less efficient.</li>
	<li>	Mechanical - some horses walking in a circle could do it. Mechanics/INT Average but you would need deep cycle batteries/capacitors (Electronics/INT Difficult) or else the power goes out the moement they stop.</li>
	<li>	Coal/Wood - a steam boiler requires a heat source, ie a furnace, the steam boiler a (Mechanics/INT Challenging test to create) and a turbine or crankshaft arrangement to transfer power (a Mechanics/INT Difficult challenge to make).</li>
	<li>	Solar-powered electrical generators can be a good source of power, if you can find one or the materials needed to make them (Savenging/INT Heroic). Solar-powered water stills and heaters are relatively easy to make (Mechanics/INT Challenging) as long as you can find the polished metal and mirrors for it (Scavenging/INT Challenging)</li>
	<li>	Wind - A windmill can be made of an airplane propeller and a car's drive train can be hooked up to a low-yield generator (Mechanics/INT Difficult). A steady supply of wind is required, but it can be worth it.</li>
	<li>	Hydroelectric - a waterwheel with a magnet attached to it can generate power enough to run some lights or even a power tool or two - Mechanics/INT Challenging. A steady supply of water is required, but it can be worth it.</li></ul></li>
	
	<li>Find a water source & a way to maintain it. Iodine tables, hydrogen peroxide, chlorine to treat - make sure to boil untreated water. 
	
	<ul><li>Can be stored in large tanks, IBCs but even that can go bad after six months. </li>
	<li>Running water requires manual or powered pumps and plumbing - a Craft(Plumbing)/INT Average or Mechanic/INT Challenging task. Boiling sterilizes water and can make for a comfortable bath, so gas, wood or electric heaters are useful (Mechanical/INT Challenging to set up).</li></ul> </li>
	<li>Find food - and then learn to harvest and store it yourself. 
	<ul><li>Hydroponics gardens are rather challenging to set up - Agriculture/INT Very Difficult and Plumbing/INT Challenging or Mechanic/INT Challenging. </li>
	<li>Building grain silos from dumpsters and scrap wood are also good projects - Engineering/INT Average.</li></ul></li>
	
	<li>Communication - ideally a ham radio. Walkie talkies last as long as batteries do. </li>
	
	<li>Lighting - oil lamps, flashlights, candles. Light bulbs will require power. 
Wiring a power system with lights is relatively easy - Mechanics/DEX Average - while making lightbulbs is a lot more challenging - Electronics/INT Very Difficult.</li>
	
	<li>Transportation - finding and maintaining good vehicles can be a problem. Things fall apart and need repairing, gas becomes rarer. Some tasks, like changing tires, is very easy while others can be much harder. Potentially modifying cars - weapon mounts, armor plating? </li>
</ul>

<b>Machinery of Death:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Guns- more common in some places than others. If over used and/or under cleaned, they can jam, break or explode.
	<ul>
	<li>Pipe Shotgun Jury-rigging - 1 hour task. Involves a length of pipe, a shotgun shell and a roofing nail. Requires a Mechanics/INT Average test but will never have a reliability higher than moderate. After your one shot, you have a four-foot club ready to use. </li>
	<li>Makeshift Musket - seal one end of a large-bore rifle or shotgun, drill a touch hole and pin, rig a simple trigger to power a lit wick in to the touch hole - Craft(Weaponsmith)/INT Difficult. Add some gunpowder - Craft(Gunsmith) or Science(Chemistry)/INT to figure out how much. It is probably unreliable and will never be any better than reliable.</li>
</ul></li>
	<li>Ammo - Without ammo, guns are just fancy clubs.
	<ul>
	<li>Black powder can be made from a mix of charcoal, sulfur, potassium nitrate that is wetted with alcohol and then filtered through a screen (Demolitions or Science(Chemistry)/INT Average to create).<br>Reliability: Breakdown rolls per 10, 20, 100, 200 and 400 rounds. </li>
	<li>Smokeless powder is typically used in more modern cartridges and is difficult to make in a jury rigged lab due to nitroglycerine. Demolitions or Science(Chemistry)/INT Very Difficult to try to craft. <br>Reliability: Breakdown rolls per 10, 20, 100, 200 and 400 rounds.</li>
	<li>Casting bullets and reloading cartridges is a skilled task - Craft(Gunsmith)/DEX Average - that requires special tools (a ram press, bullet molds, primer jig). Primers must be made separately - Craft(Gunsmith)/DEX Challenging.</li>
</ul></li>
	<li>Explosives - black power and smokeless powder aren't going to cause very much damage unless turned in to a pipe bomb. 
	<ul>
	<li>Nitroglycerin isn't too difficult to make - Demolitions or Science(Chemistry)/INT Challenging plus some sulfuric and nitric acid and glycerin) but it's hard to store (has to be below 56 degrees) and move - requires simple dexterity tests or harder depending on conditions, and failure can be fatal. Pop a jar of it somewhere, shoot it from afar - boom. It cannot be thrown, though.</li>
	<li>Dynamite can be made of nitroglycerin allowed to soak in to a non-explosive filler like wood pulp and then carefully wrapped in to sticks - Demolitions or Science(Chemistry)/INT Very Difficult. </li>
	<li>Solidox bombs cam be mixed with sugar to make a reasonable explosive - Demolitions or Sciences(Chemistry)/INT Average.</li>
	<li>Bleach can be boiled down with white gas, petroleum jelly and wax to make a rough-hewn plastic explosive. Demolitions or Science/Chemistry/INT Difficult.</li>
</ul></li>
	<li>Melee - table saw blades welded to tire irons, sheldge hammers with spikes, et cetera. Generally these are easy projects, Mechanic/DEX Average, and the resulting weapon is 1 die type higher than the unmodified. </li>
	<li>Armor - Grabbing a football helmet and cross-country biking gear requires no expertise, vut shaping plate armor or a heavy curass from saddle leather does. Such projects fall under a Craft(Armorer or Tanner)/DEX Challenging or perhaps a Mechanic/DEX Difficult check. The results match the equivalents in the core book, but are 1 EV higher unless three success levels were achieved.</li>
</ul>

<div class="heading">Post-Apocalyptic Shopping List</div>
<div align="right">To Make Life a Little Easier</div>
<p><b>Survival Gear:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Good, sturdy backpacks</li>
	<li>Shelter that hasn't been trashed by looters, zombies, fire, explosions, or driving the car in to the living room</li>
	<li>Windows that still have glass in them</li>
	<li>Tents</li>
	<li>Sleeping bags and blankets</li>
	<li>Waterproofing</li>
	<li>Boy Scout manuals, plant identification and herbal remedy books</li>
	<li>Pillows that haven't gone flat or moldy</li>
	<li>Bug Repellent</li>
</ul>

<b>Weapons:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Ammo - always more ammo</li>
	<li>Gun cleaning supplies</li>
	<li>Some kind of lighting, don't want to be reloading in the pitch dark</li>
	<li>Powder</li>
	<li>Bowstrings and new arrows - can you make your own?</li>
</ul>

<b>Clothing:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Clean and not tattered underwear.</li>
	<li>Shoes and shoelaces.</li>
	<li>Gloves.</li>
	<li>Small things like buttons and warm clothes from last winter. Will you be able to find a new one for next year?</li>
	<li>Velcro wears out, zipper break. Where's the duct tape?</li>
	<li>Sewing needles, safety pins, and thread for clothing and equipment repair.</li>
	<li>Bras and other support that isn't worn out - elastic in spandex, waistband of underwear, elastic woven in to socks to hold them up.</li>
	<li>Belts, helps tote around tools, not to mention keep your pants up.</li>
	<li>Holsters, for the type with at-the-hip weapons.</li>
</ul>

<b>Mechanics/Vehicle:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Vehicles left outside and unattended for six months are going to be in poor shape</li>
	<li>Road surfaces are going to start deteriorating, and anything road services would normally clean won't be dealt with - potholes, plants in cracks, accidents, abandoned vehicles, trees, powerlines, garbage...</li>
	<li>Boats require a lot of care, and they can be traps as well as escape routs</li>
	<li>Bridges require maintenance, and what do you do if you're in a car or a boat and the drawbridge is in the wrong position?</li>
	<li>You're going to want to find back-up car parts <i>before</i> you really need them - the last thing you want is to jump in to your car running from a horde and have the car not even star</li>
	<li>Various fluids - brake fluid, anti-freeze, wiper fluid, oil, WD-40. </li>
	<li>Pumps for both gas and water, as well as water filters</li>
	<li>Tires - you're going to need a lot of them running over zombies on streets that are littered in rubble.</li>
	<li>Small parts to repair generators.</li>
	<li>Nails, and hardware stores will have less than you hope.</li>
	<li>Hand tools like hacksaw blades, drill bits, scissors. Do you know how to sharpen a blade without ruining it? Hammers can break, too.</li>
	<li>Alcohol can make a good fuel or disinfectant - does anyone know how to make a still?</li>
</ul>

<b>Personal Hygiene:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Toilet paper - and toilets that still work.</li>
	<li>Soap.</li>
	<li>Toothpaste - and toothbrushes that you'd actually want to put in your mouth.</li>
	<li>Hairspray and other aerosols - can also use with a lighter for a makeshift flamethrower.</li>
	<li>Contacts and glasses - the apocalypse wasn't meant for the blind, good luck finding spare glasses with the right prescription.</li>
	<li>Time to take a bath or a shower.</li>
	<li>Feminine hygiene products - pads can make a good makeshift bandage and you can tear a tampon open and make a bandage with some tape, but maybe it's time to find one of those fancy menstrual cups for that time of the month.</li>
	<li>Someone who can cut hair semi-decently.</li>
	<li>Razor blades (and razors).</li>
	<li>Chewing gum and breath mints.</li>
	<li>Nail files and clippers.</li>
	<li>Q-tips and cotton balls.</li>
	<li>Sponges.</li>
	<li>Baby supplies - diapers, food, formula, wipes, oil, rash cream. Pedialyte may taste like crap but it's more efficient than gatorade. Bid wounds require big bandages and diapers are made to be absorbent.</li>
</ul>

<b>Medication/Healthcare:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Medications that require refridgeration, like insulin.</li>
	<li>Condoms or birth control - people aren't going to stop having sex, but they probably won't be wanting children.</li>
	<li>Vitamins to make up for poor diet. Don't want to be getting scurvy, do we?</li>
	<li>Psychiatric medications - antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, anti-anxiety medications. The people who need them are going to still need them.</li>
	<li>Surgical supplies - who wants to run to the hospital where the first wave of the injured went? It's going to be hard to find anything sterile.</li>
	<li>Painkillers and anti-inflammatories - aspirin, tylenol, nsaids, steroids, opioids.</li>
	<li>Stimulants - caffeine withdrawl sucks ass.</li>
	<li>Sports wraps, padded crutches, joint braces.</li>
	<li>Allergy medication.</li>
	<li>Asthma inhalers.</li>
</ul>

<b>Utility:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Strong magnets - very useful and hard to make.</li>
	<li>Get anything rats will eat (which is anything) away from where they can get to it (which is anywhere)... Wax, soap, anything in a cardboard box or paper bag, books, leather goods, clothing, sleeping or injured peopple....</li>
	<li>Cigarettes - nicotine can be used to prevent infections and be used as a pesticide too.</li>
	<li>Animals - man's best friend, after all. Guard dogs, horses for transportation, cats can keep vermin in check, hens can keep a supply of fresh eggs... Worst case, they make a meal themselves.</li>
	<li>Fastenings - twist ties, nuts and bolts, et cetera.</li>
	<li>Rubber bands.</li>
	<li>String and rope.</li>
	<li>Lighting - you're going to want something better than an oil lamp or candle eventually, it can give headaches and ruin vision.</li>
	<li>Lighters, flints, et cetera for lighting fires/</li>
	<li>Flashlights - there will be a bulb shortage at some point.</li>
	<li>Fuels, including vehicle fuels, heating/cooking fuels and generator fuels.</li>
	<li>Batteries, rechargable and not.</li>
	<li>Writing equipement - pens or pencils, notebooks, binders, post-its, et cetera.</li>
	<li>Metal is going to rust if it's left outside and can't be maintained - this includes locks and fences.</li>
	<li>Empty non-rusted dumpsters can make a rather lame (but secure) shelter in desperate times, or potentially a zombie trap.</li>
	<li>Furniture can make life a little more comfortable, or be used as barricades.</li>
	<li>Duct. Tape.</li>
	<li>Recreational activities that require no power, aren't strenuous, don't make babies, are quiet, don't attract zombies and don't need a lot of light.</li>
	<li>Musicians and their instruments.</li>
	<li>Chemicals - anything that breaks down or is volatile.</li>
</ul>

<b>Food:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Seeds for next year - most commercial seeds don't breed true or you wouldn't need to buy more next year.</li>
	<li>Cheese isn't just spoiled milk.</li>
	<li>Dairy, but cows need to be milked every day and you're going to have to have access to a bull.</li>
	<li>Beer, wine, whiskey, vodka.</li>
	<li>Fresh meat, and maybe some pepto-bismol until you learn how to properly clean and cook an animal.</li>
	<li>Readily available drinking water.</li>
	<li>Fruit and vegetables.</li>
	<li>Refined sugars.</li>
	<li>Soda is going to go flat... drink the plastic bottles first.</li>
	<li>Eggs.</li>
	<li>Yeast. </li>
	<li>Yogurt culture.</li>
	<li>Other leavenings for baking fresh bread.</li>
	<li>Coffee, tea, hot chocolate - the packages will last a while, but eventually mildew will get them.</li>
	<li>Means of storing food - tupperware, plastic bags, canning jars, vaccuum sealers, preservatives, dehydrators... coolers, thermoses and those little blue ice packs.</li>
	<li>Things to store good water in that - glass is heavy and plastic can break.</li>
	<li>Can openers - sure they'll eventually break, but the manual ones don't need batteries.</li>
</ul>

	<li>Carpenters</li>
	<li>Electricians</li>
	<li>Plumbers</li>
	<li>Blacksmiths and farriers</li>

	<li>Tool and die makers</li>
	<li>Doctors, nurses and pharmacists</li>
	<li>Farmers</li>
	<li>Dentists - do you reaaaally want to deal with an infected tooth root abscess in the apocalypse?</li>
	<li>Teachers</li>
	<li>Gunsmiths</li>
	<li>Chemists can possibly help make new ammo.</li>
