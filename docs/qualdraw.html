<p><b>Absent Minded</b>: 1 point Drawback. <br />
Some people are forgetful, especially in their old age. They periodically forget everything from appointments to daily rituals. At ZM discretion, the player with this drawback must pass an intelligence test to remember the information needed to pass a skill check. He can attempt to remember again in two minutes.</p>

<p><b>Acute/Impaired Senses</b>: 2-point Quality or Drawback<br />
This Quality/Drawback must be purchased separately for each sense: sight, hearing, touch, smell or taste. Normally, the five senses are represented by the Perception Attribute. Acute or Impaired senses indicate one or more senses that are higher or lower than normal for a person with that Perception Attribute. When bought as a Quality, an Acute Sense gives the character a +3 bonus to any Perception-related Test or Task that relies on that sense. If acquired as a Drawback, an Impaired Sense gives a similar -3penalty to Perception-based Tests or Tasks.Some Impaired Senses (hearing and sight in particular) can be easily corrected in the modern agethrough the use of glasses, hearing aids and similar devices. If the impairment is eliminated by the use ofsuch devices, the Zombie Master should reduce the value of the Drawback to 1 point.</p>

<p><b>Addiction</b>: Variable Drawback<br />
An addict craves a substance and must have it,even against his better judgement. Most addictivesubstances eventually impact on his health. When an addicted character hasn’t gotten his usual “fix,” he suffers from debilitating withdrawal symptoms. Most mental actions (e.g., any Tasks or Tests using Intelligence, Perception or Willpower) are at a penalty equal to the value of the Drawback (so, a character with a 2-point Addiction suffers a -2 penalty to most mental actions) until the addict can get what he needs. Strong addictions have a penalty of -3 to all physical actions in addition to the above penalty on mental actions.</p>

<p>The value of this Drawback is determined by the severity of the addiction and the relative effects of the drug or substance. Chroniclers should adjudicate the game effects of a “high” on a character. This can range from a small action penalty for being slightly“buzzed,” to the complete stupor of a heroin trip. In the game, as in real life, drugs are dangerous and unpredictable, and an addict character is often unable to control himself.</p>

<p>Addiction Point Value: <br />
Habitual drinking or smoking: 1 point[/div]Heavy drinking orsmoking, light use of mari-juana or LSD: 2 points<br />
Heavy use of marijuana or LSD:3 points<br />
Alcoholism, habitual use of barbiturates or cocaine: 4 points<br />
Habitual use of heroin, heavy use of barbitu-rates or cocaine: 5 points<br />
Heavy use of heroin: 6 points</p>

<p>This problem cannot be easily overcome. Resisting addiction requires a series of daily Willpower Tests. For each Willpower Test up to the level of the character’s Willpower, these Tests are Simple. For each one after that, the Tests are Difficult. All Tests suffer a penalty equal to the point value of the Drawback, plus an additional -1 to -4 depending on the strength of the drug and its avail-ability (tobacco is so available and addictive that Willpower Tests are at a minimum penalty of -4 or even higher). Once the character accumulates 10 Success Levels in succession from successful Willpower Tests, one character point may be spent to reduce the strength of the addiction by one point. Another 10 Success Levels in succession are needed for the next point, and so on, until the Drawback is eliminated. If any Test is failed during the course of accumulating the 10 Success Levels, the accumulation process must begin again.</p>

<p><b>Attractiveness</b>: 1-5 point Quality or Drawback. <br />
Attractiveness costs 1 point per level if bought as a Quality, or adds 1 extra character point if acquired as a Drawback. After character creation, Attractiveness can change only by events that modify the character’s entire appearance, either through scarring or plastic surgery. Attractiveness can range from -5 to +5 in humans.A +1 or +2 make the person stand out in a crowd and attract attention unless the character somehow hides his features. At +3 or +4, the character can easily make a living through looks alone, as a model or entertainer. At +5, the character would be as comelyas the top models, beauty pageant contestants and movie stars in the world. On the other hand, at -1 or-2, the person has homely features, or unsightly blemishes or scars. At -3 or -4, the character’s features are downright repulsive. At -5, people will be taken aback by the character’s appearance; looking at him will be a source of discomfort.</p>

<p><b>Charisma</b>: 1-5 point Quality or Drawback. <br />
This trait represents the personal magnetism and leadership qualities of the person, ranging from -5 to+5. A character with a Charisma in the negative range is instinctively disliked by most people he meets.People are naturally inclined to antagonize or avoid him. Charisma can be added to any Task where the character is trying to influence other people. Negative Charisma, of course, reduces the chance that any attempt to influence people will work.</p>

<p><b>Class Clown</b>: 1 point drawback.<br />
The class clown uses humor as a nerve relaxer. Never taking anything to seriously, and always seeming like they aren't phased. They crack jokes at inappropriate times and generally get disliked for it. People also tend to not take what they say seriously because of all of the jokes.</p>

<p><b>Contacts</b>: 1-10 point Quality. <br />
Contacts are people that the character knows. Ranging in usefulness and living condition, based on how many points of Contacts are taken. Consult the Zombie Master so details can be worked out.</p>

<p><b>Covetous</b>: 1-3 point drawback<br />
A Covetous character wants certain things and is prepared to go to great lengths to acquire them. He may be motivated by love of money, lust for sensual satisfaction, hunger for power, or the search for glory. Whatever he desires, be it fame, fortune or influence, he will do almost anything to get it, limited only by any sense of caution or morality he may have -- and in some cases, not even by that. A Covetous character usually refrains from breaking his own moral code or the laws of the land in the pursuit of his goals, but if a golden opportunity presents itself, the temptation may be just too great. There are four types of covetousness, based on what the character wants: Greed (money and wealth), Lechery (sexually attractive people), Ambition (power and influence), and Conspicuous (fame and renown). It is possible to covet two or more of those things, but each additional source of desire adds but a single point to the value of this Flaw.<br />
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Level 1</span>: The first level is relatively mild. The character knows what he wants, and he spends a great deal of time and effort to attain his goals, but he won’t break his own rules or those of society to do so. His desire otherwise dominates his life, however. Most of his actions should be directed towards achieving his objective, directly or indirectly.<br />
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Level 2</span>: The second level is stronger -- presented with enough temptation, the character may act even if it goes against his better judgment or morality. He may resist if the action he contemplates is truly wrong and reprehensible -- stealing credit for a heroic deed performed by a friend, for example -- but resisting requires a Simple Willpower Test, at a penalty of -1 to -3 if the temptation and possible rewards are great.<br />
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Level 3</span>: The third level is the strongest -- a desire so strong that it often overwhelms any scruples the character may have. When presented with temptation, he can only avoid acting by passing a Difficult Willpower Test, with penalties ranging from -1 to -5 depending on the size of the “prize.” For a high enough reward, the character will turn on friends or loved ones, and even betray his cause or principles.</p>

<p><b>Cowardly</b>: 1-3 point Drawback. <br />
This Drawback has three levels of intensity, worth 1, 2 and 3 points respectively. The level of the Drawback acts as a modifier to any Willpower Test or Task to resist fear, intimidation or bullying. For example, a character with a 2-point Cowardly Drawback incurs a -2 penalty to any Fear Test.<br />
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Level 1</span>: At the first level, the character avoids taking unnecessary risks, but fights when cornered (or when he thinks he has the upper hand). Simple Willpower Tests are necessary to avoid fleeing or surrendering when confronted by what the character considers to be superior foes. The same goes for taking even small chances, like confronting the boss, asking for a raise, complaining about some problem, or the like.<br />
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Level 2</span>: The second level of this drawback is stronger. The character needs to pass a Simple Willpower Test to fight back even when he thinks the odds are in his favor, and needs to pass a Difficult Willpower Test to avoid fleeing dangerous situations, or taking chances.<br />
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Level 3</span>: The last level is the worst, requiring Difficult Willpower Tests to get involved in confrontations or risky situations even when the character has a good chance of succeeding. Truly dangerous or heroic acts are simply impossible; the character never knowingly or willingly endangers himself, and may actually even betray his friends if he thinks he will save himself in the process.</p>

<p><b>Cruel</b>: 1 or 3 point flaw.<br />
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Level 1</span>: This character would never hurt a friend or a loved one. Enemies, especially those who have really angered him, are a different matter. He enjoys inflicting pain (mental or physical) on those he feels “deserve what they get.” Characters with this level of cruelty are capable of committing atrocities under the right circumstances, but will not go out of their way to find opportunities. This is a 1-point Drawback.<br />
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Level 2</span>: This person is a true sadist, and never passes up the chance to inflict pain on others. Even friends and loved ones are not safe from him. When it comes to enemies or those who get in his way, he enjoys nothing so much as their utter destruction or humiliation. When no enemies are available, he uses his “talents” on those around her. This is a 3-point Drawback; people with this Drawback will rarely keep any friendships, and will quickly gain enemies. Level 2 Cruel Drawback is restricted from players without special permission.</p>

<p><b>Delusions</b>: A variable drawback.<br />
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Prejudice</span>: The belief that a group of people(racial, ethnic or national) has certain characteristics(positive or negative). While everyone has some prej-udices in some way or another, a delusional personstaunchly holds to these beliefs. In some cases, theperson refuses to trust or befriend any member ofsuch a group, regardless of the merits of the individ-ual person. Such a Delusion is worth 1 to 3 points,depending on how intense the belief is, how large agroup it applies to, and how it dominates the character’s life. At the 1-point level, the character could bean “Archie Bunker”-type bigot; at 3 points, he wouldbe a rabid white supremacist.<br />
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Delusions of Grandeur</span>: This person thinks he issomebody far greater and more powerful than shereally is. In extreme cases, the character thinks that heis a historical or mythological figure like Napoleon orSherlock Holmes. The more common type has anexaggerated sense of overconfidence: “I am a genius,but nobody understands me -- which is why the bestjob I’ve held is cashier at a 7-11” (1 point); “I am theMessiah; prepare for the Second Coming!” (3 points).<br />
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Phobia</span>: A Phobia (however defined) is worth -1 to -3 points depending on the severity. So, claustrophobia would be worth -1 if the character is uncomfortable in enclosed spaces and -3 if the character is unable to enter an elevator without suffering an anxiety attack. <br />
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Weird Delusions</span>: Any strange belief that flies inthe face of reality. Some examples: “Aliens talk to methrough my wristwatch,” “I have to wear this tin foilcap so the laser satellites don’t make me kill again,”“Dogs are the Spawn of Satan, and must bedestroyed.” The value depends more on what thecharacter does about the Delusion than about theDelusion itself. For example, if the character in thelast example simply refuses to pet dogs, and avoidsbeing next to a dog, a 1-point Delusion would be suf-ficient. If he tells people about his beliefs all the time,and keeps pestering any dog-owning friends andneighbors about the dangers of keeping such mon-sters around, a 2-point Delusion would be appropri-ate. If he carries his insanity to its “logical” conclu-sion and starts hurting or killing dogs, the Delusion isworth 3 points and he is likely to get in trouble withthe law (assuming any law men are left alive).<br /></p>

<p><b>Fast Reaction Time</b>: 4 point Quality. <br />
Fast Reaction Time allows the character to always go first at the start of combat. If more than one character has Fast Reaction Time, they are sorted in alphabetical order.</p>

<p><b>Good/Bad Luck</b>: 1 point/level Quality or Drawback<br />
Each level of Luck counts as a +1bonus (or -1 penalty) that can be applied to a Task orTest, once per game session. Multiple levels can beadded together for a big bonus on one Task/Test, orspread around several different actions. For example,if a character has 3 levels of Good Luck, he can get a+3 bonus on one action, a +1 bonus to three actions,or a +2 bonus for one and a +1 bonus for another. With Good Luck, the player decides when it comes into play. Bad Luck, however, is in the hands of theZombie Master, who chooses when it affects a givenTask or Test.</p>

<p><b>Hard To Kill</b>: 1-5 Point Quality. <br />
A survivor that is hard to kill has an amazing strength. Each point of Hard To Kill adds +3 to max hit points, and +1 to all survival tests.</p>

<p><b>Honorable</b>: 1-3 point Drawback.<br />
-<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Level 1</span>: These characters do not lie or betray friends or loved ones, or people they respect. Anybody else, especially people from groups they dislike or are prejudiced against, are fair game. This is a 1-point Drawback.<br />
-<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Level 2</span>: This code of honor is more complex, and applies to everyone, friend or foe. The character always keeps his word and does his best to fulfill any promises he makes. He will not betray the trust of others once he has accepted it. Note that the character may be reluctant to give his word except in a good cause, because once it has been given he will abide by it. This is a 2-point Drawback.<br />
-<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Level 3</span>: This person lives by a strict set of rules that control most of his actions towards others. In addition to all the other restrictions above, he will refuse to participate in acts of betrayal such as ambushes, striking a helpless or unsuspecting foe, or cheating in any way. Lying is anathema, and he will only lie in cases of extreme need. Even then, he will feel guilty and will not do a very good job at deceiving; any tasks requiring lying will have a -2 to -6 penalty, determined by the Zombie Master.</p>

<p><b>Humorless</b>: 1 point Drawback. <br />
The Humorless character lacks the ability to laugh at life, and takes everything with the utmost seriousness. Other people’s attempts at humor leave him cold or annoy him. Most people find this facet of his personality to be unattractive or bothersome. Clowns and practical jokers most likely select the Humorless as their favorite target.</p>

<p><b>Lazy</b>: 2 point Drawback.<br />
 Lazy characters do their best to not be active unless necessary or they want to. Skills cost a normal amount up until they reach the level of their most associated stat, and after that cost an extra point.</p>

<p><b>Emotional Problems</b>: Variable Drawback<br />
Those with Emotional Problems react in unreason-able ways to some situations and problems. The reac-tion can be anger, pain or anguish, typically more extreme than normal. Maybe a traumatic event in this life has made them thisway. These emotional problems can be triggered bydistressful but relatively ordinary events in normallife; they prompt a very strong reaction from a disturbed character. A commontheme in fiction involves characters who in the course ofthe plot manage to overcome their flaws. Emotional Problems can be overcome by characters during play.This should always be roleplayed. If the player was ableto convey the inner struggle of his character over thecourse of several Stories, the Zombie Master might allow him to eliminate the Drawback without having to “pay” any Experience Points to do so (see Experience,p. 118).<br />
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fear of Rejection</span>: This person is afraid of rejection, and when he experiences rejection (or thinks hehas been rejected), he feels hurt and angry. People with this problem may be afraid to make friends orapproach people they are attracted to, and if their fears come true, will harbor a great deal or resentmentand anger. This is a 1-point Drawback. <br />
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Depression</span>: This character’s emotional problem smake the very act of living seem like a hard chore. Common symptoms of Depression include sleep problems (either over sleeping or bouts of insomnia),severe procrastination (to the point that the sufferer may lose his job), and a lack of interest in anything. A character with Depression is at -2 to most Tasks,and tends to avoid becoming involved in anything. This is a 2-point Drawback. A severe shock may snapsomeone out of this state for a while (a life-threatening crisis will do it), but the character will sink backinto inactivity afterwards. Certain drugs and psychiatric treatment can reduce the effect of this problem(which will also reduce its value).<br />
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Emotional Dependency</span>: These types tend to be “clingy” and overly dependent on others. Once they make a friend, they want to hang around him all thetime. When involved in a relationship, they are excessively needy. This behavior tends to annoy people around them. This is a 1-point Drawback.<br />
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fear of Commitment</span>: Whenever this character starts feeling too close to somebody, he becomes afraid andstarts pulling back. Maybe he is afraid that if he letssomebody get too close, they will hurt him, and it’s notworth the pain. Or perhaps he fears that if he reveals toomuch about himself, the other person will see the “real him” and will be appalled or disgusted. This makes it very difficult to have a healthy relationship with either friends or lovers. This problem is a 1-point Drawback.<br></p>

<p><b>Multiple Identities</b>: 2 points/Identity Quality<br />
Some characters have more than one identity. This false person comes complete with such records as abirth certificate, a social security number, and a credit rating. Only characters with criminal, espionage or law enforcement connections are likely to have this Quality, because convincing papers require access to good forgeries and computer records. Each fake identity costs 2 character points. Note that characters traveling under aliases or who have purchased a fake driver’s license do not need to purchase this Quality. Each Multiple Identity grants a set of papers and records that pass all but the closest scrutiny. Most police organizations will be fooled by the fake identity; an all-out investigation by such agencies as the FBI or NSA would reveal the truth.</p>

<p><b>Nerves Of Steel</b>: 3 Point Quality.<br />
Those with Nerves Of Steel do not take fear checks from anything but the most frightening of experiences, and even in those situations he gains a +4 to resist the fear.</p>

<p><b>Obsession</b>: 2-point Drawback<br />
A particular person or task dominates the charac-ter’s life, to the exclusion of most other things. Topursue his Obsession, he will go to almost anylengths (as limited by his morality). He may neglect other duties, both personal and professional, to pursuethat which fascinates him. The Obsession may be a person (who may or may not be aware of his feelings, but who almost certainly is upset about their intensity) or a task (like getting revenge on somebody, or performing some important or notorious feat).<br />

<p><b>Paranoid</b>: 2-point Drawback<br />
“They” are out to get you. Trust no one.Everything is a conspiracy, everyone is keeping secrets. This character never knows when somebody is going to turn against him. A paranoid character expects treachery at every turn, and rarely trusts even his friends and relatives. A character with this Drawback sees conspiracies and danger everywhere, including places where there are none. This makes his stories and beliefs less likely to be believed, even when they are true. Paranoid characters often suffer from Delusions and Emotional Problems (their point values are determined separately).</p>

<p><b>Photographic Memory</b>: 4 Point Quality. <br />
Survivors with this amazing skill remember everything and every detail that they see. They automatically gain a +1 bonus to teaching, and after the 3rd point, their skills cost 1 less experience to increase.</p>

<p><b>Physical Disability</b>: Variable Drawback<br />
This Drawback covers any physical problems affecting the limbs of the character. A disabled character may suffer from limb loss, spinal column dam-age, and any number of tragic impairments. The possibilities are discussed below.<br />
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Painful Injury</span>: Endurance is reduced by ¼ due to a previous injury that caused lasting damage and creates constant pain. This is a 1 point drawback.<br />
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bad Leg</span>: Movement is reduced by ¼ due to an old injury or a physical defect. The character has a noticable limp. This is a 1 point drawback.<br />
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Missing or Crippled Arm/Hand</span>: The hand inquestion cannot be used to grab or hold objects. AnyTest or Task requiring two hands is at a disadvantage(-3 or worse) or simply impossible. This is a 2-pointDrawback. A character with a prosthetic hand canovercome some of these problems, reducing theDrawback to 1 point in value.<br />
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Missing or Crippled Leg/Foot</span>: The character isunable to walk or run normally. With the help ofcrutches or a cane, he can move at up to one-third thenormal Speed value of the character. Hand-to-handcombat Tasks are at -2. This is a 3-point Drawback.Prosthetics can reduce the penalties, increasing speedto up to half-normal, and reducing combat penaltiesto -1. This reduces the Drawback value to 2 points.<br />
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Missing or Crippled Arms</span>: Both arms are miss-ing or crippled. The character cannot use any toolsnormally. Some people with this handicap havelearned to use their feet with great skill to compen-sate for their loss. This is a 4-point Drawback.<br />
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Missing or Crippled Legs</span>: The character isunable to walk. Without the help of a wheelchair, thebest he can do is crawl or roll on the ground. This isa 4-point Drawback.<br />
-<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Paraplegic</span>: Both arms and legs are crippled ormissing, or the character is paralyzed from the neckdown. Almost all physical activities are impossible.Aspecial wheelchair, operated with the neck ormouth, can help the character move around (if theunfortunate has access to such instruments).Someone needs to take care of all the basic needs ofthe character, from feeding to changing him. Thishighly debilitating trait is an 8-point Drawback.<br />

<p><b>Reckless</b>: 2 point Drawback. <br />
A reckless character acts first and thinks second. Impulsive and willing to do crazy stunts to get to his goals. This does not mean a reckless person is suicidal, just that they will be the one to walk across a tight rope over a pool of zombies in order to get at a hatchet.</p>

<p><b>Recurring Nightmares</b>: 1 point Drawback. <br />
The person has terrible, terrible nightmares that recur. War veterans often have this fatigue. In recent zombie days, many others have them. Every night, the zombie master checks if a character afflicted with this Drawback suffers from a nightmare. If the character has a nightmare, he awakens immediately and gets no further rest. He loses D4 Endurance for the next day.</p>

<p><b>Resistances</b>: 3 Quality Points each. <br />
Disease, Poison, and Fatigue are choosable Resistances. Disease and Poison Resistances each give a +4 bonus to resisting their respective tasks. Fatigue Resistance lets the survivor recover endurance at two times the normal rate.</p>

<p><b>Resources</b>: Variable Quality or Drawback (2 points/level, positive or negative)<br />
The character’s level of Resources determines how much material wealth he has access to. This trait varies widely. Some levels are described below.<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Destitute (-5)</span>: The character has no money, the clothes on his back, maybe ten dollars’ worth of stuff and maybe a shopping cart. Lucky to scrounge a few dollars a month.<br />

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Average (0)</span>: Owns $15,000 in property. Has an income of $2,500 a month before taxes.<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Middle Class (+1)</span>:Owns $50,000 in property (will usually include a house or condominium, not to mention vehicles). Has an income of $5,000 a month before taxes.<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Well-off (+2)</span>: Owns $300,000 in property. Has an income of $10,000 a month before taxes.<br />

Each additional level adds an additional $5 million in property and $200,000 to monthly income.</p>

<p><b>Secret</b>: 1-3 point flaw.<br />
A secret must be discussed with the zombie master as it is capable of direct and lasting consequences (including such things as sudden execution) being placed upon the character. Examples of a 1 point Secret would be something that damages ones reputation and livelihood. A 3 point secret would result in the character eventually being killed for the secret being revealed.</p>

<p><b>Showoff</b>: 2 Point Drawback. <br />
The Showoff often does whatever he can to stand out, including stupid acts such as running through a crowd of zombies to save a kitten. Anything that makes them stand out and have attention placed upon them.</p>

<p><b>Situational Awareness</b>: 2 Point Quality. <br />
Characters with this Quality gain a +2 bonus to perception checks to sense trouble or danger in their immediate surroundings. This also makes them almost impossible to sneak up on, applying their bonus to stealth task resistance rolls.</p>

<p><b>Status</b>: Variable Social Quality or Drawback (1 point/level, positive or negative) <br />
This trait represents the standing of the character in the eyes of the people around him. It includes any fame, glory or notoriety the character might have.Note that wealth and Status are often linked; a character gets a bonus to his Status equal to one-half his Resources level (if positive). 0 is middle-class American; -5 is a homeless person, +10 is a member of an ancient noble house, a movie mega-star, or the hero of millions.</p>

<p><b>Zealot</b>: 3 point Drawback. <br />
A zealot is a person whose beliefs (political, religious or personal) are so strong that they dominate his life and behavior. Zealots are willing to sacrifice anything, including their lives (or the lives of others) in service to the ideals they hold dear. These characters are dangerous to themselves and others, and show a total disregard for the law whenever the law conflicts with their beliefs.</p>




<div class="heading">AFMBE One of the Living</div>
<p><b>Bag of Tricks</b>: 4 point Quality. <br />
This person always seems to have the right tool for the right job. It's a little unnerving. Whenever the player goes out of the safety of the sanctuary, they are assumed to have a small bag that has all the simple tools someone might need to do simple things. Back at the base, they have access to a contact that can procure anything... for the right price.</p>

<p><b>Bilingual</b>: 2 point Quality. <br />
This person was raised in a bilingual household and can choose two native languages at skill 5 for each on creation.</p>

<p><b>Green Thumb/Black Thumb</b>: 1 point Quality or Drawback. <br />
People with a green thumb are adept at growing plant life, any person tasked with growing crops or plants may roll twice to determine how well the plant grows - they may then choose which outcome. People with the Black Thumb can only roll their skill level for growing or maintaining crops or plants.</p>

<p><b>Hallucinations</b>: 3 point Drawback.<br />
The character hallucinates. Why? It is unknown. Perhaps a terrible trauma caused it, or a genetic flaw in the persons brain. Either way, hallucinations come and go. Sometimes without the person thinking they are hallucinating. (Hallucinations must be rolled for by the ZM.)</p>

<p><b>Insomnia</b>: 3 point Drawback.<br />
For some reason, this person cannot sleep. If he does sleep, she only sleeps for a few hours. Whenever an insomniac tries to sleep, they must roll a simple 1d10 check. On a 1 or 2 they wake and suffer 1d6 endurance damage. If wakened by Recurring Nightmares, they cannot go back to sleep and suffer both Endurance penalties.</p>

<p><b>Jack Of All Trades</b>: 3 point Quality. <br />
Knowledgable about a little of everything but a lot of nothing, this character is able to perform any skill they do not know at +1. It does not give them a free point in every skill, just lets them pretend they know what they are doing.</p>

<p><b>Jury-Rigging</b>: 3 point Quality. <br />
Some people go past a junkyard and see memories of another time, or nothing but, well, junk. Others see opportunity. Jurry-Riggers are the "Mechanical Opportunists" of the world and can cobble things together like a boss. When you need a flamethrower, this guy puts them together with two fire extinguishers and a vacuum tube. When attempting to cannibalize and jury-rig something, people with this quality roll it twice and take whichever one they want.</p>

<p><b>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</b>: 1-4 poinr Drawback <br>
Characters with this Drawback display some sort of obsessive behavior. This could be anything from constant hand washing, to Kleptomania, to the need to arrange all the chopped-up zombie parts into neat rows. Select the type of OCD upon creation. The level of the disorder reflects the difficulty modifier to resist the obsession when it comes about.</p>

<p><b>Strong Stomach/Weak Stomach</b>: 2 point Quality or Drawback<br />
A person with a strong stomach can eat mildly toxic or "off" foods without taking a penalty. A person with a weak stomach can't tolerate a lot of food, often throwing up or going to the bathroom every five minutes whenever something doesn't agree with them. Whenever a character eats something outside of his normal diet or that may be tainted, they take a constitution test and failure means rejection of the food, often violently.</p>

<p><b>Suicidal Tendencies</b>: 5 point Drawback <br>
 This person has crossed the mental line and cannot recover from it. She thinks about harming herself frequently. Too much stress can cause her to immediately pump a bullet into their brain. When failing a fear or skill test, the character makes a will power test against how much he failed by. Success means they are fine. Failure means they give in to their tendencies and cause themselves harm. They still roll to avoid the damage or save themselves, but at a much higher difficulty. </p>

<p><b>Threat Detection</b>: 3 point Quality. <br />
Sometimes you just know when that zombie is about to jump your bones. Sometimes you just get that feeling that a sniper rifle is pointed at your head. On a successful perception test, a person with this quality gets a feeling in their gut or breast or brain that danger is lurking nearby.</p>




<div class="heading">Pulp Zombies</div>
<p><b>Animal Companion</b>: 1 to 4 point Quality <br />
The character is accomapnied by an animal of unusual loyalty and intelligence for its type, anyways. This animal's cost is 1 point. If the animal's intelligence is completely uncanny - approaching human level - it raises the cost of the quality by 1. If the animal companion can fight as well as or better than an average human, the cost increases by 2; if they can fight better than the average Survivor-type character, the cost increases by 2.</p>

<p><b>Trademark</b>: 1 point Drawback <br />
The character has some kind of identifying tag that is associated with their adventures. It should be relatively easy to do, but gives away the relationship between the item or action in question and the person. They are completely incapable of giving up their signature move.</p>





<div class="heading">Fistful o' Zombies</div>
<p><b>Fast as Hell</b>: 1 point Quality <br />
The character is incredibly quick on the draw gaining +3 to their Initiative total whenever they takes part in a head-to-head showndown or the first time that they draw their pistol in a firefight.</p>

<p><b>Number One With A Bullet</b>: 3 point Quality. <br />
Lots of people are good at shooting, but only a few can mimic the gungeneers of the old west. People with this quality can throw a tin can in the air and shoot it twelve times in the same spot before it hits the ground. Players who are Number One With A Bullet halve the penalty for called shots.</p>





<div class="heading">Dungeons & Zombies</div>
<p><b>Ambidextrous</b>: 3 point Quality. <br />
An ambidextrous person gains a third free action at no penalty each turn that they can use to defend themselves with or attack with if using a weapon in each hand.</p>

<p><b>Danger Snese</b>: 1 point/level Quality. <br />
Some people have a knack for knowing when something isn't right. Any time that the character with danger sense is unaware of potential danger, they can roll a simple perception test to notice the danger, adding levels of Danger Sense as bonus to the test.</p>




<div class="heading">All Tomorrow's Zombies</div>
<p><b>Emotionless</b>: 2 or 3 point Drawback.<br />
Those with this drawback rarely feel emotion. The 2 point level of it still allows people to be capable of feeling emotion, but they will only act on it in times of great influence, such as when the person they secretly love is about to die. Even then they will try to rationalize it away. They are at -1 to social rolls. The 3 point emotionless person is more like an artificial intelligence. They think logically with no room for any emotions, often leading to cold and analytical choices. These people are at -2 to social rolls.</p>





<div class="heading">AFMBE Homebrew</div>
<p><b>Adrenaline Junky</b>: 2 point Drawback <br />
The character is constantly drawn to situations wherein the risk of death or injury is a distinct possibility. The problem isthat a character with this drawback enjoys the rush of endorphins. A Difficult Willpower test is required for the character to sit in out and not do anything scary, thrilling or foolish. If more than one week goes by without this endorphin rush, the character begins to suffer the effects of the Mental Health Problems (Depression) drawback. Don't let this guy drive the getaway car... The driver may not be unduly reckless, except with regard to the possibility of physical danger.</p>

<p><b>Animal Magnetism/Animal Hostility</b>: 1 to 5 point Quality/Drawback<br />
This quality/drawback may be bought from levels 1 to 5, with each level providing a positive or negative modifier to the character's interactions with nonhuman animals. A character with Animal Magnetism is able to elicit a more positive response from animals, while a character with Animal Hostility is likely to be either ignored (at best) or attacked (at worst) by animals. Note that this quality does NOT allow the character to communicate with animals. It represents an understanding (or lack thereof) of how to behave around animals in order to get better results when working with them.</p>

<p><b>Cityslicker</b>: 4 point Drawback <br />
The character is definitely out of his or her element in rural areas. All skill and attribute checks outside of urban areas are made at -1 (best conditions, i.e. inside a home) to -4 (worst conditions, i.e. alone in the woods after dark). The City slicker is plagued by mud in uncomfortable places, biting insects, sunburn, thorns, and chittering critters.</p>

<p><b>Delusions</b>: A variable drawback.<br />
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Overcompensation</span>: The character has a trait, attribute, ability, skill or other characteristic that he or she is convinced is subhuman in rating. As a result, the character constantly attempts to draw attention away from this perceived weakness by focusing (often loudly and obnoxiously) on personal qualities they perceive (rightly or wrongly) as being adequate or superior. <br />
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Overconfident</span>: The character believes he or she is very good at something, when in reality they are not. This could include believing they are mechanics, electronics engineers, born leader, great hunters, natural born killers, etc. or are more skilled than they actually are. This isn't as bad as Delusions of Grandeur, as the character doesn't believe they are a greater person, but can be far more dangerous in that they greatly overestimate their own abilities.The character, depending on the severity of his or her overconfidence, will sooner or later loose the confidence of anyone with whom they are associated after ruining a few good engines, breaking the last gun, or shorting out the last functioning wireless laptop. Depending on the situation, the results could range from annoying to deadly. This Drawback must be associated with a skill or vaguely related skill the character initially possesses at level 1 or 2.Ergo, a decent automobile mechanic might convince himself or herself (and worse still, others) that they could make a helicopter flightworthy, an enthusiastic hunter might end up treed by their own prey, and a medical technologist might attempt to operate on a subdural hematoma.. This Drawback is the manifestation of the old saying that "Alittle knowledge is a dangerous thing."<br />
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Exaggeration</span>: The character blows everything out of proportion. Three zombies become thirty, fifty marauders become an army. A few cans of food glimpsed through a dirty window becomes a fully-stocked grocery store. This Drawback isn't as likely to affect the afflicted character directly as it is to afflict others who will quickly come to distrust anything the character has to say. A character with an extreme case of this Drawback would be considered a compulsive liar.</p>

<p><b>Dud</b>: 1 to 2 point Drawback<br />
Your character is particularly inept at something. Pick something at which your character isn't good. For 1 point the Dud is narrow in scope. Examples include Drops Pistol When Firing, Gets Lost in the Woods, Cuts Self With Knives and Scissors, Trusts All Relatives and Acquaintances, Falls Off Roofs, Can't Change a Flat Tire, Pick Up Lines, and other narrowly-focused categories. For 2 points the Dud is broad in scope. Examples include Breaks Machines, Can't Shoot Straight, Can't Fight, Gets Lost All the Time, Can't Run, Can't Lie, Klutz, Making Friends, and other broad categories.Being a Dud gives your character a -2 penalty on all rolls involving the character's particular lack of ability.</p>

<p><b>Emotional Problems</b>: Variable Drawback<br />
Those with Emotional Problems react in unreason-able ways to some situations and problems. The reac-tion can be anger, pain or anguish, typically more extreme than normal. Maybe a traumatic event in this life has made them thisway. These emotional problems can be triggered bydistressful but relatively ordinary events in normallife; they prompt a very strong reaction from a disturbed character. A commontheme in fiction involves characters who in the course ofthe plot manage to overcome their flaws. Emotional Problems can be overcome by characters during play.This should always be roleplayed. If the player was ableto convey the inner struggle of his character over thecourse of several Stories, the Zombie Master might allow him to eliminate the Drawback without having to “pay” any Experience Points to do so (see Experience,p. 118).<br />
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Short Fuse</span>: especially during times of stress, but at pretty much anytime, the character becomes VERY VERY angry and is subject to a scary version of the Reckless drawback. Characters with a short fuse tend to break a lot of things, including their hands from punching walls in frustration. A 3 point version of this drawback might be called Berserker.In this case, the character becomes so incensed at the sight of enemies, living or dead, that they will enter combat and never retreat or be subject to Fear Checks. This may seem pretty cool, but since most Deadworlds describe hordes of the undead, Berserkers typically don't last very long.
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Survivor Guilt</span>: 2 point Drawback. Irrational guilt over surviving where others have died in the same event is most often manifested as Endurance loss similar to that caused by the Recurring Nightmares drawback.</p>

<p><b>Empathetic</b>: 2 point Quality <br />
Your character, either through true altruism or a careful study of human behavior, can more easily determine a person's emotional state. This gives a +2 to all rolls involving interacting with that person (i.e. saying what they need or want to hear, etc.).Alternately, consider this Quality as a 2 point Knack. This Quality does not necessarily go hand-in-hand with Good Judge of Character. Plenty of people empathize with others and consequently find themselves involved with people who will take advantage oftheir kindly nature. Whether the Empathetic character is cynical or altruistic is up to the player.</p>

<p><b>Flashbacks</b>: 3 poinr Drawback <br>
In situations of great stress, or prompted by appropriate stimuli, the character has a chance at experiencing flashbacks that haunt his psyche. Perhaps she saw her lover being devoured, maybe she was part of a war. She experiences these flashbacks for 1d10 turns, but may make a will power test each turn to snap back to reality.</p>

<p><b>Good Judge of Character</b>: 2 point Quality <br />
Your character can read people like an open book. +2 on all rolls involving determining what another person wants, needs, expects, feels, thinks, whether they are trustworthy, etc. Alternately, consider this Quality as a 2 point Knack.</p>

<p><b>Harried</b>: 1, 2 or 4 point Drawback<br />
Some people are always in search of guidance, and your character is at the top of their list. Your character, whether or not they actually know anything about a given subject, is constantly approached by others wanting information and advice on an infinite variety of issues. This Drawback could be added by a ZM after a character has proved himself or herself to be successful at an important endeavor. These will often be born victims or zombie fodder.<br />
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Level 1</span>: The character is constantly interrupted at home and work by others asking about firearms, babies, raising children, repairing automobiles, selecting weapons, planting crops, buying computers, etc. Your character can claim to have no knowledge of the subject, but no one will believe them. This could lead to resentment by extras. When the zombies attack, people who know the character will step up their questions and get more and more frantic, eventually posing a danger to the character as well as the uncertain extras.<br />
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Level 2</span>: The character is physically hampered or impaired in their normal activities by the constant barrage of questions from people with problems. As above, no one will believe that the Harried character doesn't have the right answers, and may harbor dangerous resentment when the character is unable to come through for them. When the zombies attack, people who know the character(and many who are just listening)will believe that the character knows the best plan of action, possibly resulting in large numbers of casualties among the extras (and possibly including the character).<br />
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Level 3</span>: The character will be physically followed by people who believe the character is their best bet for survival. The character may very quickly find himself or herself with a tribe or community. Some extras may simply believe that the character "knows a lot" or is "good" at surviving, while others may come to believe that the Harried character is some sort of Messiah or Fountain of All Knowledge. When the zombies attack, people from far and wide hear about the character and flock to his or herside, convinced they stand a better chance of survival by throwing in with the character. Note that these followers will not necessarily be well equipped, armed, or knowledgeable.</p>

<p><b>Hayseed</b>: 4 point Drawback<br />
The character is definitely out of her or her element in urban areas. All skills and attribute checks outside of rural areas are made at -1 (best conditions, i.e. inside a home) to -4 (worst conditions, i.e. alone in the city after dark). The Hayseed is plagued by traffic laws, scam artists, crowds, salad forks, and corporate etiquette.</p>

<p><b>Knack</b>: 1 or 2 point Quality <br />
Pick something for which your character has a Knack (a skill or ability with which they are particularly gifted). For 1 pointthe Knack is narrow in scope. Examples include Hunting, Wood Working, Finding Water, Check Fraud, Riding Horses, Bicycle Stunts, Always Finds "North", Pick Up Lines, and other narrowly-focused abilities. For 2 pointsthe Knack is broad in scope. Examples include Marksmanship, Fighting, Repairing Machinery, Scrounging, Athletics, Gambling, Crime, Cowboy, Mountain Man, Accounting, Born Killer, Computer Whiz, Excellent Driver, Making Friends, Good Sense of Direction, Never Gets Lost, and other broad categories.Having a Knack gives a +2 to all rolls involving thecharacter's Knack.</p>

<p><b>Medical Health Problems</b>: Variable drawback<br />
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Asthma</span>: During periods of physical exertion or when subjected to high levels of allergens suchas pollen, dust, and mold, the character will experience difficulty breathing. This lowers Endurance points by half and reduces Speed to 1/4 normal. This is a 3 point drawback. If treated by medication (albuterol, pseudephedrine, steroids, etc.), this drawback is worth 1 point. <br />
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chronic Fibrocystic Myalgia</span>: This medical condition is most often manifested in muscle spasms, joint pain, and mental disorientation. In game terms, a character afflicted with CFM suffers the effects of sleep depravation each night on a roll of 1-7 on D10. Every 1D6 + 1 days the character must sleep for at least twelve hours to recover Endurance lost in this way. During attacks of the "Fibro-Fog", the character suffers a -1 penalty to all rolls pertaining to perception and mental attributes. The character may have trouble concentrating and may be unable to read easily. This is a 3 point drawback. If treated by beta-blockers, seizure medications, or serotonin reuptake inhibitors, this drawback is worth 1 point.</p>

<p><b>Nose for Business</b>, 2 point Quality <br />
+2 on all business transactions, including barter and haggling. Alternately, consiser this Quality as a 2 point Knack.</p>

<p><b>Obsession</b>: 2-point Drawback<br />
A particular person or task dominates the charac-ter’s life, to the exclusion of most other things. Topursue his Obsession, he will go to almost anylengths (as limited by his morality). He may neglect other duties, both personal and professional, to pursuethat which fascinates him. The Obsession may be a person (who may or may not be aware of his feelings, but who almost certainly is upset about their intensity) or a task (like getting revenge on somebody, or performing some important or notorious feat).<br />
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Control</span>: the traditional and much-hated Control Freak that has to be in charge whether or not they are the best suited for the job. Coupled with the drawback Emotional Problem (Short Fuse), you have a potentially very dangerous person if your character has to rely on group cohesion.<br />
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shoplifting/Kleptomania</span>: Don't let characters with this drawback near National Guard checkpoints. A truly frightening implication would be if this obsession were severe enough to cause the character to attempt to steal from the living dead or from areas overrun by the living dead. <br />
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Food</span>: The character, either through a traumatic event or genuine mental illness, is obsessed with obtaining food. The character mayor may not be obsessed with eating the food or be overweight. This Drawback is appropriate for characters in a Post-Rise Deadworld where food is scarce. Variations of this Obsession could exist for any items that are scarce in a Post-Rise Deadworld. Two examples follow. <br />
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ammunition</span>: The character, most likely as a result of a traumatic experience, is obsessed with obtaining ammunition. The character, however, is not often inclined to actually usehis or her supply of bullets. The character might hesitate to fire ammunition unless there is an immediately lethal threat, or insist on retaining noless than 50 rounds at any time, all in the event that the ammunition will be needed later for something truly important. The end result is that the obsessive character may wait too long to be of use to either himself/herself, or others.<br />
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Light or Fire</span>:The character is obsessed with obtained and retaining sources of light and the means with which to power or fuel them. This obsession likely originated with a previous traumatic event that occurred in total or near darkness.Additionally, this Drawback might also be associated with Phobia:Darkness. The character, if their Obsession is severe, may insist on lighting being present at all times, which could be dangerous when fire is involved, or when stealth is a necessity. The character isn't necessarily a Pyromaniac -they just want to make sure they can see what's going on around them at all times.</p>

<p><b>Resources, Post-Rise</b>: Variable Quality or Drawback<br />
Paper money is good for toilet paper or kindling, and gold coins can be filed into arrowheads. Resources, Post-Rise represent a cache or caches of trade goods (preserved food, batteries, ammunition, spare parts, etc.). It can also represent a stronghold or safe house that has been zombie-proofed and probably fortified against human antagonists as well. Conversely, a negative Resources, Post-Rise rating might represent a lack of equipment or being stranded far from home in an unfamiliar land.</p>

<p><b>Repeat Offender</b>: 1 point/level Quality/Drawback <br />
The character has a long history of criminal activities (in Pre-Rise or Early-Rise campaigns) or socially unacceptable activities (in Post-Rise campaigns) along with a degree of infamy directly related to the points the character invests in this Quality/Drawback. Foreach level, the character gains +1 on rolls involving a criminal activity or activities (i.e. mugging, finding a good fence, homicide, theft, etc.). The character also gains a +1 Adversary for each point taken (i.e. Police, local militia, tribal authorities, etc.). Each level also increases the size of the area in which the character is known as a Repeat Offender. To possess this Quality/Drawback, the character must truly stand out from the crowd and set a shining example for murderers, looters, and other criminal recidivists everywhere.</p>

<p><b>Sure Footed</b>: 2 point Quality<br />
The character never looses his or her balance. Well, almost never, anyway. +4 on all rolls to remain standing or not fall over. +1 on all Athletics, Acrobatics, Dancing, and Running rolls.Combat Specialty, 2 point Quality The character is particularly good at some aspect of combat. The most obvious example is someone with an uncanny knack for shooting zombies in the head or decapitation with an axe or other nasty sharp object. When properly equipped, the character gains an additional +2 to any rolls involving the Combat Specialty. Examples include Attack, Defense, Head Shots, Decapitation, Non-Lethal Shots, and Evasion. Alternately, consider this Quality as a Knack.</p>

<p><b>Trivia</b>: 1 point Quality <br />
As Well-Read(see below), but with less practical applications (i.e. knowing the gestation period of a koala, what the Inuit word for "dead" is, etc.). The character is a veritable fountain of information that is largely useless in practical terms. To recall Trivia that is actually useful to a situation at hand, the character must make an Intelligence roll, difficulty determined by the ZM and the details of the situation. On the other hand, the ZM may determine that the character occasionally recalls something applicable (i.e. "Those are preserved rations from the old MIR space station...good for about six years, I think...").</p>

<p><b>Two Left Feet</b>: 2 point Drawback<br />
The character can fall down while standing still. -4 on all rolls to remain standing or not fall over. -1 on all Athletics, Acrobatics, Dancing and Running rolls.</p>

<p><b>Well-Read</b>: 1 point Quality <br />
The character reads or has read a great deal, and has a high level of reading retention. This Quality is similar to the Photographic Memory Quality presented in the core rulebook, but only covers material that has been read. If this Quality is taken with Photographic Memory, the character gains an additional +1 to all rolls allowed by the ZM.</p>

<p><b>Zombie Bait</b>: 4 point Drawback <br />
Something about the character is attractive to zombies, such as a large extra-tasty brain or plenty ofmeat on his or her bones. Given a choice between the Zombie Bait and any other character, zombies will go after Zombie Bait every time.</p>
