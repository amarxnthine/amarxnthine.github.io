<div class="heading" id="skills">Skill/Attribute Tests</div>
<p>Unless the Story-Driven Method is employed, all actions are resolved in one basic manner. Roll a ten-sided die (D10) and add the Attribute and/or skill numbers the Zombie Master deems applicable. Tell the result to the Zombie Master, who adds or subtracts any modifiers (for example, noticing some-thing is more difficult in darkness than in broad daylight). If the final result is a 9 or higher, the action succeeds. If the result is less than 9, the attempt failed. The higher the total value, the more successful the action is (in some cases, just being successful is enough; in others, the degree of success may have some significance). This basic rule applies when using skills, engaging in combat, and so forth.</p>

<p><b>Tests Using Skills & Attributes </b></p>

Most actions, from sneaking around in the dark to writing the Great American Novel, are considered to be Tasks. A Task always uses one Attribute and one skill. The Zombie Master decides which Attribute and skill are appropriate to the action at hand. The die is rolled, and the applicable Attribute, skill and modifiers are added to the result. The higher the traits used are, the greater the chance of success.</p>

<p><b>Tests Using Attributes Alone </b></p>

<p>Some actions use only a character’s Attributes; no skills are applicable. Some examples include lifting things (which uses Strength), remembering something (which uses Intelligence), and so on. These situations are known as Attribute Tests, or just Tests. There are two types of Test: Simple and Difficult.</p>

<p>Simple Tests are relatively easy things - lifting an object using your entire body, for example. To resolve a Simple Attribute Test, roll and add the Attribute involved, doubled. For example, a character with a Strength of 2 adds 4 to the roll.</p>

<p>Difficult Tests are more challenging; lifting some-thing with only one hand, for example, makes for a Difficult Strength Test. In those cases, only the value of the Attribute involved (do not double it) is added. This, of course, reduces the chances of success.</p>

<p>For example, Ashe is wandering through a forest at night, alone. What Ashe does not know is that a zombie is prowling these selfsame woods, and is closing in on him. The Zombie Master tells Ashe to roll aD10 and add his Cast Member’s Perception Attribute,doubled. The woods are pretty quiet, and zombies are not known for their subtlety. The creature is not even trying to be quiet, making this a Simple Attribute Test. Ashe’s Perception is 4, which doubled adds a total of 8 to the die roll. Ashe rolls the die and comes up with a 7, for a total of 15. The Zombie Master says“Ashe, you hear a guttural growling noise behind you. Something is rushing through the forest towards you. It should reach you in less than a minute. It’s so loud you heard from it some distance away. What do you do?”</p>

<p><b>Determining What Attributes to Use</b></p>

<p>The Zombie Master often has to quickly decide what Attribute to use on a given Task or Test. For most situations, the relevant Attribute is described in the skill description, the Story write-up, or some-where else in the book. For tense, dramatic situations,however, the Zombie Master should avoid slowing the game down by thumbing through all that material, and let common sense guide the choice. The following rules of thumb should be enough to judge what Attribute should be used in a given Task or Test.</p>

<p><b>Strength:</b> Strength works when something requiring brute force is involved. Physical skills like Sports, Climbing or Swimming sometimes require Strength.<br />
<b>Dexterity:</b>This is one of the most commonly used Attributes. Dexterity applies to any Task or Test requiring accuracy, physical balance, quickness, and eye-hand coordination.<br />
<b>Constitution:</b> Constitution is mostly used in physical Tasks involving long-term endurance and vitality, or in Tests against diseases and toxins.<br />
<b>Intelligence:</b> Anything that primarily involves memory and reasoning uses Intelligence.Remembering a name, understanding a difficult concept or idea, solving a mathematics problem or a puzzle - all use Intelligence.<br />
<b>Perception:</b>There is some overlap between Intelligence and Perception. When in doubt, the Zombie Master can have the player use the higher of the two (or the lower for a difficult Task or Test). Generally, Perception is used to spot, recognize or identify things. The overlap with Intelligence comes from the fact that memory is used to recognize and identify things. In general, if the Task or Test involves any of the five senses, use Perception.<br />
<b>Willpower:</b> This Attribute is most commonly used defensively -- to resist other skills, powers or abilities. It is also used on Tasks or Tests where a character is trying to intimidate another. Willpower helps a person maintain eye contact during a staring contest, for example.</p>

<p><b>Unskilled Attempts</b></p>

<p>Sometimes, a character must try to do something she is not trained to do. Unskilled attempts always have a hefty penalty, but very gifted or talented people may be able to succeed even on the first attempt.Use the appropriate Attribute (do not double it), with a minimum -2 penalty (in addition to any other modifiers). Furthermore, the level of success of the Task(see later in this chapter) can never be too high. No matter how high the total outcome roll is, only a Decent outcome (second Success Level) will result from the attempt.</p>

<p>Some skills require so much training and preparation that untrained people have no chance of performing them. A penalty of -6 to -10 can be applied if the character is trying to perform very complex skills. For example, trying to perform surgery with no help other than a few medical manuals incurs a -10 penalty. Alternatively, the Zombie Master may rule that the attempt automatically fails (or, to keep the players in suspense, she may let them make rolls -- who knows,they might get lucky).</p>

<p><b>Resisted Tasks/Tests</b><br />
Sometimes, a character tries to do something andanother character (either a Cast Member or one of the Supporting Cast) tries to stop or hinder her. Similarly,an attempted action may be noticed or foiled by the target or victim of the action. When this happens, a Resisted Task or Test must be resolved.</p>

<p>Resisted Tasks or Tests use the same basic rule mentioned above. Both sides in the contest get to rolland add the appropriate Attribute or skill. If both fail(no one rolls over 9), neither side accomplishes the effect desired. If one fails and the other succeeds, thesuccessful character prevails. If both succeed, theresults are then compared, and the higher total result,after adding and subtracting all modifiers, is the win-ner of the contest. Some examples of Resisted Tasks and Tests are discussed below.</p>

<p>--- <b>Arm Wrestling</b>: This requires both sides to make Simple Strength Tests; the higher successful result wins the contest. For dramatic purposes, the contest might be spread over more than one roll (two out of three, or three out of five, for example).<br />
--- <b>Pursuit on Foot</b>: Both sides use Dexterity and Constitution. If one person started running first, she gets to add a +2 to the roll. Also, the side with the higher Speed gets to add the difference between the two Speeds. Just subtract the lower Speed from the higher one, and add the result to the faster character’s roll. The winner manages to either catch up with or lose the pursuer, depending on her intention.<br />
--- <b>Sneaking</b>: The person doing the sneaking uses Dexterity and Stealth. The target uses either Perception and Notice or a Simple Perception Test.<br />
--- <b>Combat</b>: Combat is described in more detail later in this chapter. Many combat actions consist of Resisted Tasks or Tests.</p>

<p><b>Base Modifiers Table</b><br />
Routine:No roll needed<br />
Easy: +5 or more to the roll<br />
Moderate: +3 to +4 to the roll<br />
Average: +1 to +2 to the roll<br />
Challenging(includes most combat rolls): No modifier<br />
Difficult:-1 to -2 to the roll<br />
Very Difficult:-3 to -5 to the roll<br />
Heroic: -6 to -9 to the roll<br />
Near-Impossible:-10 or worse</p>

<p><b>Outcome Table</b><br />
A result of 9 generally means the attempt was accomplished (that’s good enough in most cases). When the degree of the success needs to be measured, however, Success Levels depend on the final result (a roll including all positive and negative modifiers).</p>

<p>9-10: First Level (Adequate): The Task or Test got done. If an artistic endeavor, it is just adequate, and critics/audiences are likely to give it "ho-hum" responses. A complex and involved Task takes the maxi-mum required time to complete. An attempted maneuver was barely accomplished, and might appear to be the result of luck rather than skill. Social skills produce minimal benefits for the character.Combat: Attack does normal damage.</p>

<p>11-12: Second Level (Decent): The Task or Test was accomplished with relative ease and even some flair. Artistic results are above average, resulting in a warm reaction from many, but not most. Complex and involved Tasks take 10% less than the maximum required time. Attempted maneuvers are skillfully accomplished. Social skills manage to gain some benefits for the character (including a +1 to further attempts on the same people under similar situations). Combat:Attack does normal damage.</p>

<p>13-14: Third Level (Good): The Task or Test was completed with ease. Artistic results are largely appreciated by connoisseurs and well-liked by the public (although some critics will be able to find something wrong). Complex and involved Tasks take 25% (one fourth) less time than normally required. Attempted maneuvers are done with seeming effortlessness, apparently the result of great skill. Social skills are not only successful, the character will be at +2 on future attempts on the same people (this is not cumulative with subsequent high rolls -- use the highest bonus only). Combat:This is the roll needed to hit a relatively small and specifically targeted area, or to accomplish a tricky shot or strikes (for strikes against specific body parts, see p. 104)</p>

<p>15-16: Fourth Level (Very Good): The Task or Test was very successful. Artistic endeavors are reward-ed with a great deal of appreciation from the intended audience. Complex and involved Tasks can be finished in half the time. Social skills produce a lasting impression on the people involved, resulting in a bonus of +3 on all future attempts in that skill involving the same people. Combat: Increase the damage rolled by 1 before applying the Multiplier.</p>

<p>17-20: Fifth Level (Excellent): The Task or Test produced excellent results. Any artistic endeavor impresses the audience greatly, leading to a great deal of recognition and fame. Social skills have a future bonus of +4, as above. Combat:Increase the damage rolled by 2 before applying the Multiplier.</p>

<p>21-23: Sixth Level (Extraordinary): The Task or Test produced amazing results, accomplishing far more than was intended. Artists gain fame after one such roll, but all their future accomplishments will be measured against this one, which may lead to the "one-shot wonder" label. Social skills gain a future bonus of +5, as above. Combat:Increase the damage rolled by 3 before applying the Multiplier.</p>

<p>24+: Further Levels (Mind-boggling): For every +3 to the total above 23, increase the Success Level by 1, and the Social skills future bonus by 1. Combat:Add +1 to the damage rolled for every additional Success Level.</p>

<p>Damage Modification Example: Luigi punches an opponent and his attack roll is a 17 (fifth level of success: +2 damage bonus). Luigi's normal punch damage is D4 x 3. Given his Success Levels, the damage is modified to (D4+2) x 3, or 9 to 18 points. Even on a bad damage roll, the attack inflicts a decent amount of damage.</p>

<div class="heading" id="combatbasic">Combat Basics</div>
<p><b>Intentions - What Will Be Attempted</b></p>

<p>At the beginning of each Turn, the Zombie Master asks the players what their Cast Members intentions are.  Each  player  gets  to  state  actions.  This  could  be something  as  simple  as  “I  duck  for  cover”  or  “I  hit him with my baseball bat” or as complex as “I aim at the walking undead’s head” or “I jump behind a crate,toss a grenade, and pray.” The Zombie Master decides if the intention is possible, if it will take one Turn or less, and what skills are necessary. The Zombie Master can point out to the player  any  risks  or  problems  the  action  may  bring about -- if the player’s Cast Member would know or understand  those  risks.</p>

<p><b>Initiative - Who Goes First</b></p>
<p>Most  of  the  time,  this  should  be  a  matter  of  common sense; the party or person who initiates the violence  usually  goes  first  at  the  beginning  of  a  fight.After the first Turn of the fight, Initiative depends on what  happened  in  the  previous  Turn.  Typically,  the combatant  who  actually  managed  to  land  a  blow  or hurt his target gets to go first. The Zombie Master can always decide who attacks first based on the particular circumstances at the time.</p>

<p>Initiative  can  also  be  determined  randomly.  To  do so, each player who has a Cast Member in the situation  rolls  a  ten-sided  die  and  adds  the  character’s Dexterity.  The  highest  result  wins  the  Initiative  for that  Turn,  and  makes  the  first  move.  The  remaining characters act in descending order of Initiative.</p>

<p>Note that certain Qualities and abilities can affect a character’s Initiative. As noted, some circumstances may also determine Initiative.  Characters  with  ranged  weapons  usually get to attack before those holding hand weapons or no weapons  at  all.  Also,  a  guy  who  sucker  punches  somebody gets  to  go  first.  A sniper  firing  on  an  unaware  target half  a  mile  away  automatically  gets  Initiative.  As always, the Zombie Master has the last word.</p>

<p><b>Performance: Who Does What</b></p>

<p>The Performance step lumps together any Tasks or Tests  required  for  the  actions  declared  during  the Intentions step. As such, a great many things can hap-pen during this step. Several are discussed below. For all  others,  Zombie  Masters  should  determine  which Task  or  Test  must  be  performed  (if  any),  and  then interpret the results of those attempts. Multiple Actions In  general,  each  character  may  take  one  action without penalty in a Turn. More than one action maybe performed, however. The main limitation is skill;dividing  concentration  is  difficult.  Each  additional action taken in a Turn has a cumulative -2 penalty. In other  words,  taking  one  extra  action  is  done  at  a  -2penalty, a third action is at -4, and so on.</p>

<p>In close combat, things work slightly differently. In that circumstance, characters may perform one attack and one defense Task or Test each Turn at no penalty. Any actions beyond that attack and defense is at accumulative -2.</p>

<p><b>Keeping Your Cool</b></p>
<p>A factor rarely taken into account in most games is the ability (or lack thereof) of people to remain con-trolled and calm while under fire. Most people who are  shot  at  tend  to  freeze  or  panic.  Only  the  very brave, the very stupid, and combat veterans are likely  to  keep  their  cool  and  do  the  right  thing  when every  instinct  in  their  bodies  is  telling  them  to  start running,  NOW!  Zombie  Masters  wishing  to  run  a heroic  game  are  free  to  dispense  with  this  factor,although  its  use  may  discourage  hot-headed  players from getting their Cast Members into firefights at the drop of a hat.</p>

<p>When being shot at, a character must pass a Simple Willpower  Test  to  continue  carrying  out  her  original intention. A failed result means the character freezes or hesitates, and loses any chance to act in that Turn.This  rule  also  applies  to  the  Supporting  Cast,  so sometimes it is a good idea to fire blindly in the general direction of one’s enemies, if only to make them “keep their heads down.”</p>

<p><b>Damage: How Much Does It Hurt</b></p>
<p>Once a character hits a target (or the enemy hits the Cast Member), the damage inflicted must be determined. Damage works differently than Task resolution. Damage is measured in points, which are marked off the character’s Life Points, or a zombie’s Dead Points. If Life Points are reduced to 0 or below, the character is critically injured and is at risk of dying. The effects of damage are explained later in this chapter (see p. 111). Most forms of damage are determinied by rolling a die; the result is then multiplied by a set number (called, for obvious reasons, the Multiplier). For example, a .22 pistol does D4 x 2points of damage. In this case, the 2 is the Multiplier,and to determine damage a four-sided die is rolled and the result is multiplied by 2.</p>

<p><b>Targeting Body Parts</b></p>
<p>These rules can be used for dramatic purposes, but add more complexity to combat. The following chart determines the penalty to the attack, and the modifier to the damage inflicted. Damage bonuses occur after penetration (if the target is not wearing armor, all damage is modified accordingly).<br />
<b>Head</b>: -4 to hit. Blunt damage is doubled; slashing/piercing is tripled. Bullet damage is modified by two levels (i.e., armor-piercing bullets inflict triple damage, normal bullets inflict four times damage,etc.). Endurance Point damage (in non-lethal combat) is quadrupled.<br />
<b>Neck/Throat</b>: -5 to hit. Blunt damage is doubled; slashing/piercing damage is quadrupled. A slashing attack on this area that does enough damage to kill the victim results in decapitation. Bullet damage is modified by one level (armor-piercing bullets inflict double damage, and so on).<br />
<b>Arms/Legs</b>: -2 to hit. Damage in excess of Life Points/3 cripples the limb; extra damage is lost.<br />
<b>Hand/Wrist/Foot/Ankle</b>: -4 to hit. Damage in excess of Life Points/4 cripples the area. Extra dam-age is lost.<br />
<b>Vital Points (heart, lungs, spine, kidneys, etc.)</b>: -2 to hit. Blunt damage is doubled; slashing/piercing damage is tripled. Bullet damage is modified by one level (see Neck/Throat bullet damage).</p>

<p><b>Special Weapon Types and Damages</b></p>
<p>Not all weapons are created equal. Some inflict harm differently than others. Of course, many of these special dam-age features are only applicable against other humans; they may be useless against zombies (see Flesh Notes, p. 147). Damage formulas that do not contain special notations like those below are consider to inflict regular damage.</p>

<p><b>Two-Handed Weapons</b>: Close combat weapons used two-handed raise the effective Strength of the wielder by 1.For example, a Strength 3 character wielding a two-handed axe has an effective Strength of 4 for purposes of damage.</p>

<p><b>Slashing/Stabbing Weapons</b>: Edged or pointed weapons have a better chance of inflicting permanent damage on their victims. An edge can slice muscle tissue and even chop through bone. A point can reach deep in a target’s vital organs. To simulate this, any stabbing or slashing damage that is applied to a target (after taking into account any armor reductions) is doubled.</p>

<p>Blunt weapons (from fists to dropping safes) do not enjoy this benefit, although they often do more general damage. Normal Bullets: A normal jacketed bullet tends to corkscrew and ricochet inside the human body, shattering bone, piercing vital organs and doing assorted forms of mayhem. Thus, normal bullet damage is doubled after penetrating armor.</p>

<p><b>Hollow-Point Bullets</b>: Expanding bullets create a greater wound cavity and tend to spend more of their energy inside the victim’s body as the bullet flattens and mush-rooms inside flesh. Armor can easily stop these bullets.Double any Armor and Barrier Value between the target and the bullet, but any damage that gets through is tripled.</p>

<p><b>Armor-Piercing Bullets</b>: These high-velocity, solid rounds punch through armor and obstacles, but they also tend to punch through the target in a relatively flat trajectory, doing reduced damage. Armor-piercing rounds halve any Armor or Barrier Value in their path, but the damage inflicted is not modified.</p>

<p><b>Shotguns</b>:Slugs are treated like normal bullets, with damage doubled when hitting flesh (there are also hollow-point slugs, which do triple damage, as above). Shot damage does not double, and any armor worn is doubly effective against it (even heavy clothing affords some protection against the lighter birdshot used in hunting shotguns). On the other hand, shot spreads over a wider area, making it easier to hit the target.</p>

<div class="heading" id="combatclose">Close Combat</div>
<p>Close combat is any fight conducted at arm’s length by people using fists, feet, or hand weapons(such as knives, swords and sticks). In close combat,the character with Initiative gets the chance to strike first. The target may attempt a defensive maneuver,like blocking the attack with a hand weapon of her own, dodging or jumping out of the way, or the like.</p>

<p>Striking at an enemy is a Task: use the character’s appropriate skill (Brawling, Martial Arts, Hand Weapon) and Dexterity. If the enemy has a hand weapon of her own, she can try to parry the attack,using her own Weapon Skill and Dexterity.Characters with Martial Arts can parry hand weapons with their bare hands; those with Brawling or no close combat skills cannot. Instead of parrying, the defender may dodge out of the way. This use s Dexterity and the Dodge Skill (if the character has it), or must be resolved as a Difficult Dexterity Test(if not). So, even an unarmed, unskilled person may try to get out of the way of an attack by passing a Difficult Dexterity Test.</p>

<p>An attack and defense set is resolved as a Resisted Task. If the successful attacker gets a higher result than the defender, her blow lands and inflicts dam-age. If the defender ties or gets a higher result, she manages to deflect or dodge the attack. Some modifiers may be applied for light (see the Ranged Combat Modifiers Table, p. 102) and other circumstances at the Zombie Master’s discretion. Otherwise, that’s all there is to it.</p>

<p>Some players may want more detail to their fights than simple attack and defense rolls. These optional rules are meant to accommodate this element. Zombie Masters should reward good intention descriptions with a few bonuses in the appropriate Task rolls.<br />
--- <b>Defensive Posture:</b> The character remains on the defensive, forsaking any chance to attack in favor of protection. A character using this tactic gets a +3 bonus on all defensive Tasks or Tests she performs on that Turn. This is a good tactic for trying to keep a superior enemy busy while waiting for reinforcements to arrive, or to gauge an opponent's skill before making a move (judging the opponent's skill may require a Task involving Perception and the appropriate Weapon Skill -- although if the attacker man-ages to hit despite the defensive posture, no Task roll is necessary).<br />
--- <b>Aggressive Posture:</b> The character goes all-out in her attack, abandoning any hope of defense to smash the enemy. This gives a +2 bonus on all attack Tasks performed that round, but no defensive Task may be made. This is a good tactic if the enemy is unarmed or if the character thinks she can take any damage inflicted by her opponent. Most of the time, though, it is too risky.<br />
--- <b>Feinting:</b> A feint is a false attack meant to distract the enemy and lower her defenses against the real strike. The feint is resolved as a Resisted Task -- the attacker's Intelligence and close combat skill against the opponent's Perception and close combat skill. The attacker's and defender's close combat skill need not be the same. The attacker might attempt the feint using Brawling Skill, while the defender attempts to read the feint using a Martial Arts Skill, for example. If the attacker wins the contest,she gets a +1 bonus on her next attack Task for each Success Level in the feint Task.</p>

<p><b>Improvised Weapons:</b> </p>
<p>Sometimes, a weapon is not at hand during a dangerous situation, and one must use an improvised weapon (a broken bottle, a table leg, chair, etc.). It will, however, be less effective than a real, balanced weapon.When using an improvised weapon, the character uses the closest Weapon Skill she has. Anything that involves thrusting sharp objects (broken bottles,forks, ice picks, etc.) uses the Hand Weapon (Knife) skill (or Sword skill, but at a -2 penalty due to the shorter reach). A longer, swung object could use Hand Weapon (Club or Sword or similar weapon) skill. If no related Hand Weapon skill is available, use a Difficult Dexterity Test to strike or defend. Used defensively, a chair or similar large object actually acts like a shield, giving the character a +1 to +2bonus to her parry roll. The Zombie Master should assign penalties for large, heavy and clumsy improvised weapons (-1 to -3 in most cases).</p>

<div class="heading" id="combatranged">Ranged Combat</div>
Ranged  combat  involves  any  sort  of  missile weapon, from a thrown stone to a machine gun. The attacker  with  Initiative  gets  to  fire  at  the  target;  this Task involves the attacker’s appropriate ranged com-bat  skill  and  Dexterity.  Range,  lighting  and  other modifiers affect the Task.</p>

<p><b>Defenses:</b>  In  ranged  combat,  the  target  has  precious few choices. She can stand his ground and fire back,  hoping  the  attacker  will  miss,  or  she  can  duck for  cover.  Ducking  for  cover  uses  Dodge  and Dexterity. If the result is greater than or equal to the attacker’s  Task  result,  the  target  was  able  to  hit  the ground  or  jump  behind  cover  in  time  to  avoid  the shot. The only problem with that tactic is that it is the only  action  the  target  can  take  on  that  Turn.  That  is why most firefights are dominated by the group that fires  first;  the  targets  are  pinned  down  and  cannot fight back.<br />
<b>Aiming:</b> A character who wishes to shoot can also take  some  time  to  aim  her  weapon.  This  delays  her attack  to  the  end  of  the  Turn  (giving  the  target  a chance  to  fire  first,  move  behind  cover,  or  perform other actions), but it makes the attack more likely to hit.  Aiming  is  a  Task  involving  the  character’s Perception  and  Weapon  Skill;  each  Success  Level adds a +1 bonus to her attempt to strike.</p>

<p><b>Modifiers:</b>Modifiers to ranged weapon attacks are listed on the table nearby. Note that range affects the Task.  Ranges  for  various  weapons  are  listed  in  the Weapons Table (see p. 134). If looking for modifiers takes too long, the Zombie Master should feel free to dispense with them, or determine them on the spot.</p>

<p><b>Firing Multiple Shots</b></p>
<p>One to five seconds is a long time for modern automatic  and  semi-automatic  firearms.  An  average  sub-machine gun has a cyclic rate (the number of bullets fired if the trigger is kept pressed) of over 600 rounds per minute -- 10 shots are fired in one second! Even a semi-automatic  pistol  or  double-action  revolver(which  fire  as  fast  as  the  trigger  is  pulled)  can  be emptied in under five seconds. The main drawback of firing multiple shots is that most rounds miss the tar-get.  While  rapid-firing,  most  automatic  weapons experience “muzzle climb” as the gun bucks and fires higher  and  higher  up.  Semi-automatics  also  experience aim-ruining recoil.</p>

<p><b>Semi-Automatic  Multiple  Shots:</b>  Any  weapon that  fires  a  shot  every  time  the  trigger  is  pulled  can fire  multiple  times  in  a  Turn.  Each  successive  shot gains a cumulative -1 penalty (i.e., the second shot is at  -1  to  hit,  the  third  shot  is  at  -2,  and  so  on).  If  the gun has a heavy recoil (a .44 magnum, for example),the penalty is a cumulative -2.</p>

<p><b>Automatic  Fire - Bursts:</b>  The  most  controllable automatic fire is short bursts of three to five shots. A burst  fires  at  no  penalty.  Each  Success  Level  in  the Task  means  the  attacker  scores  a  hit,  up  to  the  total number of bullets in the burst. For example, a shoot-er  firing  a  three-shot  burst  who  scores  two  Success Levels hits with two bullets, each doing damage separately. Success Levels only affect the number of hits,not  the  damage  (no  damage  multipliers  from  the Outcome Table apply).  If she racks up three Success Levels  or  more,  all  three  rounds  strike  the  target.  If firing multiple bursts, each successive burst suffers accumulative -3 penalty.</p>

<p><b>Automatic Fire - Rock ‘n Roll:</b> Here, the shooter keeps the trigger depressed and “hoses” the target with a  stream  of  bullets.  Most  the  bullets  are  going  to  go high as the gun’s muzzle is forced up by the constant recoil.  Each  group  of  ten  shots  counts  as  a  “group;” make a strike Task for each group. Each Success Level means  one  bullet  hits.  Again,  Success  Levels  only affect the number of hits, not the damage.  Each group after the first is at a cumulative -4 penalty.</p>

<p><b>Automatic  Fire - Suppressive  Fire:</b>  Automatic fire can be used to “sweep” an area, suppressing any targets  there  (i.e.,  making  them  kiss  the  ground  and pray  for  deliverance)  and  hitting  anybody  stupid enough to stick their head into the “beaten zone” (the area the shots are spraying). No roll is made, just the intention  to  spray  an  area  with  gunfire.  Rather  than have to look at cones of fire and complicated formulas  to  determine  the  area  covered,  assume  that  most automatic  small  arms  sweep  an  area  the  size  of  a doorway or two. Anybody straying into the area will be struck by D4(2) shots.</p>

<p><b>Ranged Combat Modifiers</b></p>
<p><b>Shotguns:</b> For  the  most  part,  shotguns  use  two  types  of  missiles: shot (small pellets contained in a cartridge), and slugs (solid shot). Shot scatters, creating a “cone” of bullets that spreads over distance. It is thus easier to hit  a  target  with  shot  than  with  a  normal  bullet. Characters using a shotgun loaded with birdshot (the smallest  pellets)  gain  a  +2  bonus  to  strike  targets  at any  range;  with  buckshot  (larger  pellets)  apply  a  +1bonus. Slugs are treated like normal bullets. Shotgun damage is treated later in this chapter (p. 105).</p>

<p><b>Point-Blank Range:</b> +1 to Strike Tasks, and add 1 to the Damage Multiplier.<br />
<b>Short Range:</b> No modifier.<br />
<b>Medium Range:</b> -1 to Strike Tasks.<br />
<b>Long Range:</b> -3 to Strike Tasks, and reduce Damage Multiplier by 1.<br />
<b>Extreme Range:</b> -6 to Strike Tasks, and reduce Damage Multiplier by 2.<br />
<b>Poor Lighting Conditions (A dark alley, candlelight, moonlight):</b> -1 to Strike Tasks.<br />
<b>Bad Lighting Conditions (Moonless night):</b> -4 to Strike Tasks.<br />
<b>Total Darkness:</b> Use a D10 roll with no other modifiers; only a natural roll of 9 or higher strikes the target. If a character makes a Difficult Perception Test, she can add each Success Level to the D10 roll,accounting for the use of senses other than sight to spot the target.<br />
<b>Multiple Shots:</b> -1 for each additional shot, or -2 if the weapon has a heavy recoil.<br />
<b>Gun Scopes:</b> A telescopic scope will add +2 to +5 to any Aiming Tasks.</p>

<div class="heading" id="fear">Fear</div>
<p>In the dark and dangerous settings of All Flesh Must Be Eaten, characters often experience frightful events. Indeed, in a world where the dead have risenfrom the ground and walk among us, it’s pretty likely that someone will see a decomposing corpse walking. In such places, even the strong-hearted get scared once in a while.Fear Tests When facing a fearsome creature or otherwise experiencing fright first-hand, Norms and Survivors must pass a Difficult Willpower Test. Inspired require only a Simple Willpower Test. If the Fear Testis failed, the victim succumbs to panic. Most of the time, the character will “freeze up” for at least a Turn. Alternatively, she may run away. Zombie Masters who want to add more detail can consult theFear Table (see next page).</p>

<p><b>Fear Modifiers</b> </p>
Certain circumstances make it easier for the character to feel afraid. Very gory and gruesome events add penalties of -1 to -4, depending on how graphic the violence is. Hideous creatures may bring penal-ties of -1 to -5. Some beings have alien or thoroughly evil auras that inspire a deep, instinctual fear in people: such creatures may bring penalties of -2 to -8 to all Fear Tests! Some of the undead creature descriptions in Chapter Six: Worlds in Hell include specific modifiers to Fear Tests.</p>

<p><b>Using the Fear Table</b> </p>
<p>The nearby Fear Table can be used when a character fails a Fear Test. Roll a D10, subtract the Willpower of the character, and apply any Fear Test penalties as bonuses. So, a -4 penalty to a Fear Test would count as +4 bonus to the Fear Table roll. If the result is less than 9, the victim was simply scared for a few seconds but was able to recover. If the total is equal to a 9 or higher, consult the Fear Table. The table uses the Success Levels to determine how badly the character suffered as the result of the terrible shock. The Zombie Master can use the Fear Table for guidance and inspiration, but she should not let dice rolls rule the game. If a result seems inappropriate at the moment or to the character, the Zombie Master should devise her own outcome or result of the fear.</p>

<p><b>Fear Table</b></p>
<p>1 - <b>Shakes</b>: All the character's actions suffer a -2 penalty for 2 Turns. Lose 1 Essence point.<br />
2 - <b>Flight</b>:Victim runs away screaming for 1 Turn. If cornered, the victim may fight or react in a more rational way. Lose 2 Essence points.<br />
3 - <b>Physical reaction</b>: Fear causes a messy physical reaction (often involving bodily functions best left to the imagination). Not only is this embarrassing, but it imposes a -1 penalty to all actions for D4(2) turns. Lose D4(2) Essence points.<br />
4 - <b>Paralyzed</b>: The character cannot move for D4(2) Turns. Only intervention by other characters (who may shake her, slap her or otherwise force her to act) will allow her to take any action. Lose D6(3)Essence points.<br />
5 - <b>Faint</b>: The shock and fear are so severe that the character collapses, unconscious. A Difficult Constitution Test is required to recover consciousness; this can be attempted every minute, or whenever somebody tries to stir the character. Lose D10 x 4 (20) Endurance points and D8(4) Essence points.<br />
6 - <b>Total Hysterics</b>: The victim becomes a screaming, babbling, totally useless maniac for D8(4) Turns. Lose D10(5) Essence points.<br />
7+ - <b>It Gets Worse</b>: Higher results are left to the Zombie Master’s imagination. They may include life-threatening effects like heart attacks or comas, or a bout of temporary insanity lasting hours, or worse...</p>

<div class="heading" id="armor">Armor</div>
<p>Since the time of the first caveman, people havebeen trying to use all kinds of materials to protectthemselves against attack damage. Heavy cloth,leather, wood, metal, ceramics and plastic have allbeen used at one time or another to turn spear pointsor bullets, to cushion blows and to, hopefully, renderthe wearer immune to harm. Most people in the mod-ern era, with the exception of police officers andsome criminals, rarely own or wear any sort of armor.</p>

<p>But armor can be found.The protection of any suit has an Armor Value (list-ed in the Armor Value Table, p. 138). Armor Valuesare expressed much like Damage effects, with a vari-able number (typically a die roll), a Multiplier, and aflat value added to the roll. This represents the factthat no suit of armor offers the exact same protectionover every inch of the body. When a character isstruck, roll the base die times the Multiplier, add theflat value, and subtract the result from the number ofdamage points inflicted. If the armor result is greaterthan or equal to the damage result, the character suffers no injury.</p>

<p><b>Armor Types and Layering</b></p>
<p>Characters may wear different types of armor overdifferent parts of the body (a helmet and a lightKevlar suit, for example). If the optional TargetingSpecific Body Parts rules (see p. 104) are used, thensimply use the armor value that applies to that specific area.</p>

<p>Some characters may want to wear two types ofarmor on top of one another; this is especially true inhistorical/fantasy scenarios where armor and paddingtypes may be combined. Modern armor is not meantto be layered; wearing a Kevlar vest over anotherKevlar vest will be extremely uncomfortable, andonly possible when the lightest form of Kevlar isused. It is also not as effective as it would appear atfirst glance. In general, when layering armor, add theaverage value of the weakest armor, halved, to theArmor Value of the heavier layer, and increaseEncumbrance by 1 step (i.e., none becomes light,light becomes medium, etc.).Encumbrance One of the problems with wearing armor is that itslows a character down and makes some things (likebeing quiet, or reacting quickly to danger) difficult.These problems are measured by the EncumbranceValue of armor. Encumbrance Values are discussed indetail in Chapter Four: Implements of Destruction(see p. 126).</p>

<p><b>Breaking Things</b></p>
<p>In game terms, all objects (doors, bottles, cars,tanks) have a Damage Capacity, Armor Value and aBarrier Value. The Damage Capacity is how manypoints of damage it takes to either destroy them orsimply render them useless. Basically, the DamageCapacity of an object fulfills the same role as LifePoints do for living beings. Armor Value is how muchdamage can be absorbed by the object without takingany damage. Barrier Value indicates how much pro-tection they afford to someone hiding behind them. Ineffect, the Barrier Value acts as “armor” that an attackmust punch through in order to hurt whatever isbehind those objects.</p>

<p>The Damage Capacity and Barrier Value are two different things. It takes more damage to totally destroy a door than to fire a bullet through it (andinjure whoever is behind it), for example. For themost part, the Damage Capacity measures how muchit takes to make the object stop functioning, or to blasta large hole (a yard/meter radius opening in the caseof a wall) in it.</p>

<p>Generally, the Zombie Master should only worryabout the Damage Capacity of objects when the Storyabsolutely demands it. If people want to smash a plateglass window, they should simply do it withoutrolling damage. On the other hand, if the charactersare using an axe to break down a door before the fireraging behind them consumes the house they aretrapped in, a few rolls to see how long it takes themto escape can heighten the tension.</p>
